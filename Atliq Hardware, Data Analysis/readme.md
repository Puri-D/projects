# Atliq Hardwares: Data Analysis

This is a data analysis project for a fictional hardware company called Atliq Hardware Company. The data used for this analysis was obtained from kaggle.com via the link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ad043santhoshs/sales-domain. 

It's important to note that this analysis should not be taken as practical business advice. The data obtained from the website may not be accurate, and the insights gained from this analysis should not be generalized or applied to real-world business decisions without further validation. This project involves a comprehensive analysis of the sales invoice data, including the following parts:

## The following tools were used in this data analysis project:

1. Python - Used for preliminary data transformation, data cleaning, and data visualization using various Python packages such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Python was also used to conduct various analytical tasks such as calculating summary statistics, and identifying patterns in sales data

2. SQL (SQLite) - Used to query and manipulate data from the database to facilitate analysis. SQL was used to join tables, filter data based on certain criteria, and aggregate data to calculate key metrics such as total revenue, number of orders, and average order value. SQL was also used to extract specific subsets of data for further analysis in Python. 


## Part 1: Exploratory Data Analysis
In this part, i will explore the Atliq hardware company's sales invoice data to get a better understanding of the dataset. This involves tasks such as checking for missing values, identifying the most popular products, determining the best-selling months, and identifying trends in sales over time.

## Part 2: Cohort Analysis
In this part, i will conduct a cohort analysis to examine customer behavior and loyalty over time. Cohort analysis helps identify patterns in customer retention and acquisition, which can provide insights into customer behavior and inform marketing and sales strategies.

## Part 3: Customer Segmentation
In this part, i will segment Atliq hardware company's customers into different groups based on shared characteristics. Customer segmentation can help companies identify their most valuable customers, understand their needs and preferences, and tailor their marketing and sales strategies accordingly.

## Part 4: An Executive Summary Dashboard using Power BI
In this part, i will create an executive summary dashboard using Power BI to provide a high-level overview of the company's sales performance. This dashboard should include key metrics such as total revenue, top-selling products, and customer segments. The dashboard should also be interactive, allowing users to explore the data and drill down into specific metrics. The goal of the dashboard is to provide a clear and concise overview of the company's sales performance, allowing decision-makers to quickly identify areas for improvement and make data-driven decisions.
