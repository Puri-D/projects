Candle Manufacturing Sales Performance Dashboard
This project is a dashboard system that I created for a small candle manufacturing company to monitor their sales performance at different levels using Microsoft Power BI.

The purpose of this project was to provide a user-friendly way for a small business with little familiarity in business technology to monitor their performance with as little manual work as possible. I have provided a dashboard system that enables monthly updates with a simple drag and drop process.

Features
This dashboard system includes the following features:

A dashboard that tracks monthly sales performance.
An interactive report that tracks company sales performance both in the product and individual level.
An easy-to-use automatic file cleaning GUI that allows the business to clean their sales data from their POS system to be ready for the analysis.
Tools Used
The tools used in this project include Microsoft Power BI, including DAX functions, power query, and data visualization. Additionally, I used Python to automate the data cleaning process, making it more efficient and error-free.

How to Use
To use this dashboard system, simply upload your sales data to the automatic file cleaning GUI and let it do the work. Once your data is clean and ready for analysis, simply drag and drop it into the Power BI dashboard system to track your monthly sales performance and individual product performance.

Conclusion
Overall, this project showcases my proficiency in utilizing Power BI and Python to create an effective data visualization tool for businesses. The dashboard system provides a user-friendly way for a small business to monitor their sales performance with ease.
