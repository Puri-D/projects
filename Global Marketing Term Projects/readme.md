# Global Marketing Term Group Project

This project was a group project for a global marketing course that was completed during my college years. The aim of the project was to determine a suitable location for a hypothetical Thailand RTD tea company to expand its operations internationally to South Korea. My primary responsibility was to oversee the consumer and competitor analysis.

## My role in the project included:

# Qualitative and Quantitative Market Selection
Conducted extensive quantitative and qualitative research to identify a suitable location for market expansion. This involved analyzing various factors, such as demographics, market trends, and consumer behavior, to identify potential markets for the product. (The quantitative analysis has been revised using python) 

# Product/Competitor Analysis
Conducted a comprehensive analysis of the company's product offerings and compared them with South Korean competitors' offerings. The analysis involved identifying the strengths and weaknesses of each product and how the company could strategically fit into the market, as well as analyzing market trends and consumer preferences.

# Consumer Analysis
Identified a potential target consumer for the product by analyzing demographic data and consumer behavior. This involved conducting surveys and interviews to gain insights into the preferences and habits of potential consumers in South Korea.

Overall, this project was an excellent learning experience that enabled me to develop skills in market research, data analysis, and consumer behavior analysis. It also showcased my ability to work effectively in a team and manage complex projects.
