I like to think I know a little bit about sound and what it takes to reproduce sound, but the tricky thing with headphones is that everybody's' ears are different. Like, they're physically slightly different which makes every single person hear the exact same sound slightly different, but there's also our individual listening preferences too, so keep that in mind as you read this review. Personally, I prefer smooth, balanced, and LOW bass (down to 20Hz), but NOT boomy bass. I also like some sparkle in the highs (8k+).Initial impressions upon arrival and setup:- The packaging looks like it's a cheap recycled cardboard of some sort. Obviously doesn't affect the headphone's performance.- The zipable case the headphones live in also seem kinda cheap and flimsy. Again, it doesn't affect the headphone's performance.- Accessories are fairly light as it only comes with a stubby little 8\" long (seriously) USB charging cable (not even a wall adapter, just USB A to USB C) and a generic 1/8\" stereo headphone cable if you want to physically plug them into a headphone jack.- The app was easy to download, install, and update. It did require making a Sony account though, so points off for that.- Pairing the headphones to my phone and also my computer was quick and seamless. I did have to restart my computer to get Windows to send audio over the bluetooth connection, but that was an issue with Windows and not the headphones.- The headphones themselves feel of good quality and are super comfy for my average sized head.- The EQ you set in the app does persist when you connect to a different sound source. For example, the EQ curve I set on my phone was not active when I then paired the headphones to my laptop and listened to the same track.- Really needs more than 6 EQ points. Sony, you can do better than just 5 predefined sliders and a bass slider (basically 6 sliders, so IDK why the bass is separate from the rest).Listening impressions:- Best sounding headset I've purchased to date and sound MILES better than my Sennheiser HD 596 (but to be fair, those sounded ridiculously unnatural and just all-around terrible).- Plenty of \"thump\" by default, but definitely dropping off significantly below 50Hz or so, which is exactly what I like to have present in my mix. You can see I've put a HUGE boost in the low lows on my EQ curve to make things like low synths, bass drops, and sub-harmonics sound even with the rest of the sound stage. Even still, the sub-bass that is there still sounds a bit thin and artificial like they're using some processing trickery to make it sound like it's playing lower than it is (there are a few ways to do this, but they're never as authentic as just reproducing the frequency properly).- Little bit \"dark\" sounding, so a slight bump in the high mids as well as a 10k+ shelf bump really helped brighten up the sound stage.- Imaging is ok but definitely not spectacular. It's only got a single 30mm driver per ear, so that one driver is covering EVERYTHING from 20Hz to 40kHz. As such, it's expected that imaging won't be super detailed, so no surprise there. I was really hoping to see at least 2 drivers per ear. By contrast, my CCA C12 in-ear-monitors (IEM's) that I use when playing on stage are about $50 and have 6 drivers PER EAR each playing a different frequency range. Needless to say, the imaging, and extension on those IEM's is a LOT better than these headphones that cost 7x the price. Due to their small form factor, IEM's can use armature drivers where 'can' style headphones like this can't use armature drivers (not loud enough), but I would still like to see 2 dynamic drivers in these just to allow one driver to focus on the highs and the other to focus on the lows rather than having the one driver trying to play the whole shebang.- Minimal, but still present, \"pressure\" sensation when noise cancelling is on, but it's not intrusive like a lot of other ANC headphones I've tried and effectively disappears when music is playing. Having a set of ANC headphones with \"pressure\" that grabs my attention is an absolute deal-breaker for me regardless of price point.Overall, these are going to be my go-to headphone for the office. They sound good enough (especially with some EQ), and are comfy enough, to have some background music playing for hours at a time while also cancelling out loud office talkers.","isVerified":true,"avatar":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","variant":"Color: Black","reviewImages":["https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61z9O09XrlL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61jpRBIWDnL._SY88.jpg"],"position":1},{"index":1,"productAsin":"B09XSDMT4F","username":"Bast","ratingScore":5,"reviewTitle":"Smaller heads, folks with hair, and sensitive temples..read this","reviewUrl":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/REW7IJXPA0PZ9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09XSDMT4F","reviewReaction":"54 people found this helpful","reviewedIn":"Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2023","date":"2023-01-18T00:00:00.000","country":"United States","countryCode":null,"reviewDescription":"First off, I havent had a chance to test all functionality yet. I am coming here in hopes of helping someone else out with their frustration.If you're nervous about dropping the money, do it. The app (if you let it) will track your usage. Get them, set an alert for a day or two before the return period is up. Try them out and then check your usage when the alarm goes off. If you need/use headphones I almost guarantee youre going to find these worth it.RE: Small headsYour head might not be too small. I realized after two days of use I was fitting them more like traditional headphones and they were siting on one or two lobes very slightly.When you fit, and while you get used to putting them on, I suggest:- lengthening the headand (as app suggests)- 'scooping' your ears lobes up and inside the pads rather than under them at all- then gently fitting headbandOnce I started doing this my fit issues nearly dissappeared(hair..). Biggest issue now is the band material is not grippy at all and I have very smooth/slick hair, so it wiggles a bit. If I troubleshoot around this I will update.Of note and Re:Sensitive TemplesThese do not need to be as secure over all (other than having the suction over the ears) as you will not want these to get wet, period. These are not designed for exercise or heavy movement. They are sufficiently set for walking around or hanging out, this protects you from losing suction without significant pressure on your temples and keeps these super light headphones EXTREMELY comfortable. Which for someone like me that gets migraines with nearly ANY temple pressure has been... life changing.The suction aspect for proper noise cancelation is fairly fundamental. It's an even bigger deal with these as they'll adjust sound and I could see if suction was lost at an inopportune moment it could be...uncomfortable.RE: HairY'all, your hair is going to need to be out of the way. I have already noticed that one or two small strands will absolutely affect the seal. I won't notice it immediately but when I move around or talk I'll notice a sound change (almost like a varying level of wubba womp like entering a tunnel or in elevation changes) and at the corresponding ear I'll find hair between my ear and headphones. If you experience this in one or both ears...check for anything preventing a seal! It's annoying to navigate but as with adjusting the fit as above the more I do it, the easier it is to do upfront/as second nature.The app is fairly easy to navigate but has a small learning curve, nothing atronimical. The only other app ive used for headphones was Jabra about 2 years ago. Theyve likely updated since but compared to the 2020 Jabra app..this app is night and day better in terms of navigation and ease of use.So far my only con has been switching between my TV and my phone. This could be me, I think this may just be a learning curve I havent yet had time to solve. What it was doing: Paired to both. Switched to phone to do some Duolingo. For some reason any adjustment i made unpaused my TV and swapped where the sound was coming from. When I re-paused my TV I'd have to reselect my phone..and then it would do this again. So for now Im just leaving the TV unpaired. I mostly dont need this anyway but thought it might be nice for my neighbors late at night.Summation without even talking about its sound quality, noise cancelation and other functions (which are amazing):These headphones are worth the price tag for the lack of weight on my temples ALONE. Everything else is  icing on the cake.If something changes I will absolutely return here to update.","isVerified":true,"avatar":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","variant":"Color: Black","reviewImages":["https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61z9O09XrlL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61jpRBIWDnL._SY88.jpg"],"position":2},{"index":2,"productAsin":"B09XSDMT4F","username":"Richard HuynhRichard Huynh","ratingScore":5,"reviewTitle":"Sony never disappoints!","reviewUrl":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R36XGSDG52PX3E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09XSDMT4F","reviewReaction":"71 people found this helpful","reviewedIn":"Reviewed in the United States on November 24, 2022","date":"2022-11-24T00:00:00.000","country":"United States","countryCode":null,"reviewDescription":"I thoroughly enjoy what Sony has to offer in their product line. I have the PlayStation 5, a Sony Bravia 4K TV and several other Sony products. Yes although I have owned a few of their product line I will not try to be biased here with the review. What got me into Sony products was really their earphones dating back to 2011! They have the best earphones you could get for $20 back at the time in 2011 and now the quality they still continue to put out never disappoints! Here's the pros and cons of the Sony WH-1000XM5.Update: I also picked up the XM4 Earbuds from Sony and take note that those are on a different level for listening to music compared to the XM5 Over the Ear headphones. Shares the same features like the XM5, not the same sound like over the ear obviously but also more marketed to those who goes to the gym and likes something more compact.Pros:Comfortable and lightweight!I don't ever have a complaint with what they have to offer when it comes to comfort. These are better than BOSE in regards as to comfort. I think the one thing that makes them comfortable also is that they are light. They weigh only about 0.56 pounds! People tend to have problems with headphones if they are heavy in my opinion! I also assume they use a low density memory foam for cushioning which is great but will eventually need to be replaced or tended to if left compressed or squished for too long.Unique featuresNoise Cancelling is top notch but not much different than their previous lines in my opinion! It is a standard these days to get noise cancelling and the headphones are great for drowning out noise if need be. They also tend to those who need to be aware of their surroundings by implementing a ambient mode like previous models. Works great and works like a charm by either taking the headphones off or covering the touch control panel. Also the Speak to Pause Music feature is insanely nice to have! Helps when your hands are busy and or you just don't want to adjust your headphones having to speak.Superb sound!The sound quality out of these are amazing! Does really well in all areas of music genres. Particularly really in low frequencies for bass! I get to enjoy these at a great volume and it pairs amazingly with my PS5 as a gaming headset! (Will mention the headphones does not come with a microphone for gaming when using a headphone jack.) As a pair of noise cancelling headphones, you can expect to hear a positively good detail in music, movies, gaming or even a phone call! They are clear and surprisingly really balanced. The microphone on these headphones for phone calls are great. Better than the previous versions.Fast charging!The charging rate of these headphones is incredible! I never knew how fast charging can be with this! There's times I have left this powered on overnight as I'm at work for my 10 hour job and it was drained by the time I wanted to use it again. In those times I left it charging and goodness greatness these were ready to go in a about 10-15 minutes!  I enjoy these so much that I'm actually glad they have a 24-30 hour battery life.Cons:Cost.Its expensive! If you can get these on sale, it's worthwhile! If it's in your budget go for it! You pay for what you get in my opinion and these are worth their weight in gold!Fitment.They don't exactly fit around my short wide neck whenever I need to take it off and be present in a conversation or in my surroundings. Not exactly a big matter or deal breaker. More so it's a personal perspective. My neck size is 15 ¾ inches in circumference and that's pretty average I believe. I have to extend these in order to keep them around my neck without compromise. They also do not fold inward like the previous Sony headphone models but again never a issue.Cushion. Yes the ear cup cushions are comfortable but again when I place them around my neck it compresses the cushion to a point where it feels awkward after putting it back on. I'm looking at other options to replace their soft fit leather design.Update: There is different earcups that you can replace the OEM cups with but it comes at a cost of I believe $60 which is worth noting.Conclusion.Worthiness of $350+ (price as of 12/07/2022) during the holidays? Yes!Personal opinionated review:Sony WH-1000XM5 or other leading competition? Sony, easily Sony. I've never been unhappy about this purchase and I tell people that Sony is industrial leading company that continues to impress people when it comes to their headphones. Beats by Dre(Apple), Apple and Bose has always been great by popularity but Sony gets appraised by quality!I will update this review as I go until they put a new model out.","isVerified":true,"avatar":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","variant":"Color: Black","reviewImages":["https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61z9O09XrlL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61jpRBIWDnL._SY88.jpg"],"position":3},{"index":3,"productAsin":"B09XSDMT4F","username":"mhans311","ratingScore":4,"reviewTitle":"Comparison to Bose NC700","reviewUrl":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R31021WW6CLXL9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09XSDMT4F","reviewReaction":"41 people found this helpful","reviewedIn":"Reviewed in the United States on February 4, 2023","date":"2023-02-04T00:00:00.000","country":"United States","countryCode":null,"reviewDescription":"I have used Bose NC700 for the past year, but saw these on sale for a great price and decided to try them. I had the XM4’s for a short time but had to return them because they were too creaky while wearing them. Luckily I have not had that same issue so far with the XM5’s. My biggest priorities for headphones is comfort, sound quality (both for music and phone calls), and noise cancellation.ComfortThe XM5’s have ear cups that are slightly larger than the XM4s and they also look slightly larger than the NC700s. This helps them go over the ears better. However, the NC700s have slightly thicker padding which makes the inside of the cup a little deeper. For this reason, I would say that the NC700s are a bit more comfortable for long periods. The XM5s are very comfortable, but after a couple of hours, I definitely start to feel them more than the NC700s. But both are great.Sound QualityThis is a matter of preference, but I prefer the deeper bass and fuller sound of the XM5s. I would say the NC700s have a more balanced sound, with far less low end. The XM5s really give a nice full bass, without it being over-bearing. I do prefer a bit more lower end than what the Bose provides. So for me, I prefer the sound quality of the XM5s quite a bit more than the NC700s.Call QualityI use my headphones for work calls several hours a day. Both the XM5 and the NC700 have great call quality and will work really well if you use them for phone calls or Zoom meetings a lot. I think I’d give the edge to the XM5s because they block out ambient noise slightly better than the NC700s, but the difference is negligible.Noise CancellationI mean, these are high end headphones and both do a great job with noise cancellation. I will say, I was surprised at how much noise the XM5s can block out. They block out voices and medium pitched noises better than the NC700s. They are both great with lower pitched things like plane noise. But I think the XM5s do a better job overall.Build Quality and DesignThis is where the Bose NC700s are just better than the XM5s. The build of the NC700s is just beautiful. They feel substantial without being too heavy, and there isn’t a seam anywhere. I also think they just look amazing. The XM5s do have seams around the ear cups and they feel much more plasticky. The XM5s are not bad, but they just are not as good as the NC700s as far as design and build quality.Battery LifeThe battery on the NC700 lasts me around 13 or 14 hours. The XM5s last around 25 hours. So it’s a pretty big difference. Charging speed seems about the same with both.Odds and EndsFeatures of each are similar. They both offer pass through audio and it works well on both. Touch controls work equally well on both. The case of the XM5s is a little bigger than the NC700s, if that matters to you. One small difference that may make a difference to some is that if you want to use the cord to plug them into a 3.5mm headphone jack, the end the plugs into the NC700s is 2.5mm. So if you lose the included cord, you will need a specific type of aux cord to replace it (2.5mm to 3.5mm). Whereas the XM5 uses a regular 3.5mm to 3.5mm aux cord.Overall I do like these Sonys better. I just wish they had the comfort and build quality of the Bose. But because of the superior noise cancellation and sound quality, I’m going to be using the Sonys from now on.","isVerified":true,"avatar":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","variant":"Color: Silver","reviewImages":["https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61z9O09XrlL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61jpRBIWDnL._SY88.jpg"],"position":4},{"index":4,"productAsin":"B09XSDMT4F","username":"Fresh and Felicia","ratingScore":5,"reviewTitle":"UNBELIEVABLE carbon fiber sound quality, improved ANC with 2 processors and 8 improved mics","reviewUrl":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1Z5IQRHE12YL4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09XSDMT4F","reviewReaction":"768 people found this helpful","reviewedIn":"Reviewed in the United States on May 24, 2022","date":"2022-05-24T00:00:00.000","country":"United States","countryCode":null,"reviewDescription":"I own Sony’s WH-1000 XM4s and the Bose 700s, two of the leading models in the industry. I had AirPods Max for a minute, but I rage-sold them. To me, the Sony and Bose are both awesome headsets. So I was psyched to hear Sony was releasing XM5s. Summer’s here, and these can get a little hot on hot days outdoors. It’s like wearing earmuffs on the beach. But, if you can get past a little sweaty ears, or if you use them indoors or on airplanes, you should be a little excited.The Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones feature, what Sony advertises, “industry-leading noise cancellation.” And they ain’t lyin. With Bluetooth 5.2 and Sony's QN1 and V1 chips, the XM5s have DUAL processors - compared to the lonely single processor of the XM4. These two processors control 8 microphones for crazy accurate noise cancellation. Think - a little computer actually sampling noise from fans, airplane engines, air conditioners, motors, and consistent noise like that  - and creates an identical but perfect opposite wave, so they kinda cancel each other out. And this time, the dual processors are capable of filtering higher frequency sounds, including some voices. It’s pretty cool tech. The first time you hear this, it’s like magic! In my video review, you can see my personal reaction.With the XM5s, noise canceling is automatically optimized based on your wearing conditions and environment. You don’t have to do anything. It knows if you’re sitting, walking, in an airplane, et cetera.No, noise reduction probably won’t completely cancel a very loud angry spouse, or a crying baby. But the over the ear closed design may help dull annoying sounds.A very small cadre of people claim they become nauseous using noise cancelling headphones, and especially the old model XM4s. I’ve never experienced this personally, but be aware it could happen. You can disable it if you need to. Some people thought the WH-1000XM4s were too snug. I thought they felt great, but they’ve improved the fit with a  new lightweight design with soft-fit leather. This material fits snugly but with less pressure on your ears while still keeping out the external sounds you don’t want to hear.There were a few other design changes – the XM5s aren’t foldable like the XM4s, and there’s a redesigned case that’s collapsible to save room in your bag when you’re wearing your headphones.With up to 30 hours of battery life, you’ll have enough power to travel halfway to the moon in one of Elon Musk’s rockets. But, in case you forgot to charge and you’re in a hurry, you can get 3 hours' worth of charge after just 3 minutes with an optional AC adapter.And unfortunately, the in-flight plug adapter is not included in the supplied accessories this time. But who uses that anyway? That’s so old school! Fortunately, there still is an aux-in for you old-school holdouts.The touch controls survived, where you can pause/play/skip tracks, control volume, activate your voice assistant, and answer phone calls. And the speak to chat lives also, where as soon as you start a conversation, Speak-to-Chat automatically stops your music and lets in ambient sound. And wear detection knows when you take them off.But – how do they sound?Sony has popped new, more rigid, 30mm carbon fiber drivers in the XM5s. They have more of an audiophile sound profile with slightly more balanced sound, better clarity, and more accurate bass. That’s important if you listen to real music, you know, with actual instruments, like rock, jazz, r and b, country, classical, and music like that. The XM4s have 40mm drivers, which will probably be better for hip-hop. The XM5s will reproduce hip-hop very accurately, meaning the way the studio producer intended you to hear it, but they probably won’t have the head-vibrating tinnitus-inducing bass many people want. TBH that's hard to find in any headphone due to physics.The XM5s support LDAC and spatial 3D audio, whatever that is, and they have also upgraded their Sony Music Studios Edge-AI music algorithm, which somehow magically guesses what musical dynamics were lost during compression and tries to replace that, so everything sounds crisp and clean without losing the bass that’s necessary in most of today’s popular music.I have heard some folks claimed the MX4s sounded “muddy” with some music. I didn’t notice that, but I’m a producer and I’m familiar with equalization. There are about 20 presets including several you can create yourself.And even without the Qualcomm APTX Low Latency chip, both my XM4s and XM5s allowed me to watch a complete movie on Netflix on my 2022 Samsung Frame television, wirelessly, from 10-plus feet away, with ZERO loss in mouth synchronization. Plus, like my XM4s, the XM5s still have dual Bluetooth pairing so you can pair them with two devices at the same time and switch back and forth between them. It's a pretty cool feature if you use them for your phone, but also want to use them to watch YouTube videos at work on your computer. But, you probably shouldn’t tell your boss about that.And the XM5s work with Google Assist, Alexa, and Siri. You can even set up Spotify playback with a few taps. Try that on your Air Pods Max.The big win seems to be a vast improvement in the sound of your voice during phone calls quality. They’re actually impressive when it comes to calling in louder rooms. I’ve made test calls on busy streets and on windy sidewalks, and my call-ee said she couldn’t tell I was actually outdoors. Apparently, the four beam-forming microphones and the dual-processor software can recognize your voice and somehow block a lot of background noise. I mean, you can still probably hear tire screeches, gunshots, and car alarms, things you’ll typically hear in the city. But a lot of the noise is just gone. Like magic!Oh – and there’s Speak to Chat. You start speaking, and the XM5s automatically adjust noise cancellation to pick up the voices of other people. No buttons, no fumbling with your phone. That’s a pretty cool feature.So are they worth the upgrade? If you have XM4s and you think your call quality is shaky, then grab some XM5s and sell your sweaty old XM4s on Craigslist. If you’re moving from Bose's Noise Canceling 700 or QuietComfort 45s, the new dual processors and 8 microphone array will provide some noticeable improvements, plus the dual Bluetooth sync, so they’re probably worth looking into. If you’re done with your Air Pods Max and prefer better compatibility with non-Apple stuff including android phones, PCs, and Sony or Samsung Smart TVs, it’s a no-brainer.","isVerified":true,"avatar":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","variant":"Color: Black","reviewImages":["https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61z9O09XrlL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61jpRBIWDnL._SY88.jpg"],"position":5},{"index":5,"productAsin":"B09XSDMT4F","username":"Worm","ratingScore":4,"reviewTitle":"It’s not 100% Noise Cancellation","reviewUrl":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2Y56TA2GYJYDC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09XSDMT4F","reviewReaction":"8 people found this helpful","reviewedIn":"Reviewed in the United States on January 16, 2023","date":"2023-01-16T00:00:00.000","country":"United States","countryCode":null,"reviewDescription":"If you want 100% Noise Cancellation, use ear plugs that are made for it not a pair of Bluetooth Headphones. Does it work great if you’re playing music or something, yeah. Having Noise Cancellation with music playing does help focus more on the songs. I wouldn’t rate the “Surround Sound”/360 audio as mind blowing, but it does the job. That being said, it’s amazing how clear some sounds can be, such as in Call of Duty… or Minecraft. Zero disappointment if you want clear audio since the ear cushion works wonders (Not sure how long they will last though). As for charging and using the audio Jack at the same time since Bluetooth doesn’t work while it’s charging, I found it a horrible experience. Just get a good charging brick, a decent length usb-c cable and charge the thing once it reaches 20%. Go eat, take a walk or do it in your sleep but that battery wasn’t lying about being able to reach 30 hours. Though I would only limit it to 20-24 hours before checking the battery limit by pressing the power button again and hearing it tell you the power level. I don’t plan on killing the battery health and you should too for this price point. As for the range, Bluetooth 5 is impeccable especially with a quality device and limited walls between you, your pc and the kitchen. As for volume control, it changes it by small increment, though holding on to the right pad with your palm does activate transparency mode and lower the volume so you can hear someone talk. Downloading the app will show you a few things btw. It’s just a little overpriced by maybe $80 bucks, but you can’t deny the microphone quality. It’s quite good on mobile but if you use OBS to record there is always that noise. That being said, it does isolate my voice quite well in a loud environment and the Noise Cancellation keeps me from hearing anyone talk though to how high I have the volume playing my content to immerse myself. But like I said, without any content playing you can still hear stuff through the noise cancellation but once you play something else on top it’s gold. If there was once feature they should’ve added it would be dual control on both ear cuffs instead of just the right. I’m not left handed but it would increase usability since I don’t always get the action I want done though to me lying down or whatnot and my hand gesture was a little off from the four main directions. Also can we get a PC App or settings? I hate having to use my phone to change a few things such as the level of noise cancellation or shutting off/on the gesture control. There are times when I forget to turn them back on and when I switch to PC/Mac I have to go back to my phone to turn those controls back on. If there is a desktop App, me not so bright. That being said, it’s a good product, just a tad overpriced. Let’s see how long I can keep it alive.","isVerified":true,"avatar":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","variant":"Color: Black","reviewImages":["https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61z9O09XrlL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61jpRBIWDnL._SY88.jpg"],"position":6},{"index":6,"productAsin":"B09XSDMT4F","username":"Laurent Park","ratingScore":4,"reviewTitle":"Incredibly comfortable and versatile headphones.

My airpods were great for comfort,, but terrible for a full day of work, and the mic quality was not great for call applications that I use.So I did some research between these headphones and other over-ear headphones like AirPod Maxes, Bose QC. I was mainly deciding between these and the AirPods since I use entirely Apple devices and went with the Sony's for price and supposedly good comfort.So here are my pros/cons after about 3 months with these:Pros:- I have a huge head and I generally have stayed away from over ear headphones for long periods of listening. These are inarguably the most comfortable headphones I have ever used. I am able to last a full 8 hour office job wearing these without too much sweat or heat, and the pressure is perfect. No headaches from wearing them all day, and it's overall been absolutely perfect. In comparison to the AirPods maxes (that I used for a day from my partner) that gave me an incredibly painful headache from the pressure after an hour of use.- Battery life / charging is amazing. 30 hours may be the industry standard but whenever I'm low, I just give it a charge for five minutes and I'm basically good for the next few hours.Cons:- I listen to a variety of music from hip hop and mostly electronic music. For songs with more emphasis on acoustics and vocals, the headphones are pretty good. However for my electronic library it leaves a bit to be desired. The bass and sometimes mids feel very muddy, and no amount of EQ I use can get it to where I like for all my music. This is where AirPods Maxes shine out. They may be 200$ more but they are inarguably better sounding with their adaptive EQ.- Not really at any fault of Sony's, but if you use Apple products you can't use the LDAC codec at all. You are missing out on a better sound quality on Apple, and can only really use LDAC with Android.","isVerified":true,"avatar":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","variant":"Color: Silver","reviewImages":["https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61z9O09XrlL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61jpRBIWDnL._SY88.jpg"],"position":7},{"index":7,"productAsin":"B09XSDMT4F","username":"Miki Villarreal","ratingScore":5,"reviewTitle":"I have fallen in love","reviewUrl":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2KPK3M3NJ6I07/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09XSDMT4F","reviewReaction":"24 people found this helpful","reviewedIn":"Reviewed in the United States on December 21, 2022","date":"2022-12-21T00:00:00.000","country":"United States","countryCode":null,"reviewDescription":"I have been looking for some good over the ear headphones and seen so many good reviews of these. I decided to try them out and these are some amazing head phones! I recently had to travel and ended up wearing them for 6 hours straight!Battery life: The battery was full and by the end of my travel it dropped to 85% so the battery life is outstanding.Noise cancellation: It was really good and didn’t create too much pressure while on. Even when the headphones were off it did an amazing job of damping outside noise. Ex: I was by a VERY loud construction site and once I put on the headphones (turned off) it almost dampened the noise completely.Ambient Mode: It’s nice, I will say that in some cases I didn’t really use it. For example if you are in a loud environment it will be extremely loud while on. Which makes sense as the point of AMB is to be aware of your surroundings but if you have sensory issues I would be mindful of it. When you do the quick ambient sound it’s really good and makes what you need to hear very clear. There is very little static noise but if you are listening closely it’s very faint.Comfort: These are so comfortable and lightweight. Part of the reason I was having difficulty choosing over the ear headphones was because many were too heavy for my liking but when I wore these I forgot I had them on. I only had to adjust them once when it hit closer to the 5 hour mark. There is very little discomfort. My only thing is being that they are so light it feels like they can slip off easily sometimes. When you have them laying on your neck it can be a little uncomfortable at least for me. They landed on my collarbones so there was just hard plastic hitting my collarbones over a bit of time. But that is just me nit picking.Few set backs: the storage of them is a little inconvenient or undesirable. I wish these could fold because the case is quite large and take ups a lot of space especially when you are traveling.Overall: I have really enjoyed the experience with these headphones! I would really recommend these to someone who has auditory sensitivity like myself because they check a lot of boxes! There are only a few things that I wasn’t a huge fan of but that was like I said me nit picking.A video that was very helpful in making this decision was by: This is Tech Today on YouTube, they really went in-depth of all the features while also comparing it to different nc/amb headphones!","isVerified":true,"avatar":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","variant":"Color: Silver","reviewImages":["https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61z9O09XrlL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61jpRBIWDnL._SY88.jpg"],"position":8},{"index":8,"productAsin":"B09XSDMT4F","username":"Brandi J.","ratingScore":5,"reviewTitle":"The best headphones I've ever owned","reviewUrl":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3LAB2EPKD3K57/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09XSDMT4F","reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","reviewedIn":"Reviewed in the United States on February 1, 2023","date":"2023-02-01T00:00:00.000","country":"United States","countryCode":null,"reviewDescription":"I went ahead and splurged on these around 3 to 6 months ago after I stepped on my XM3s in the dark and cracked the band mechanism. I do not regret my purchase at all; these cans produce such rich and full-bodied bass-enhanced sound that I can't leave a room in my house without bringing them with me.. in case I need awesome music for a bit.Funny story.. I thought the noise-canceling was just kind of mediocre this whole time, especially when I was flying back from visiting my parents and using them on a plane. The trick is to quickly press the second button toward the back on the left earpiece to activate noise-canceling. It was like the angels sang when I did that.. suddenly the music was so clear and rich, the plane noises virtually eliminated. Duh. So if you own these or are thinking about it, don't forget that tip!As I mentioned, I've owned the older XM3 model for quite a few years now and loved them; these XM5s are even better and I love them for all music listening occasions. They're a little bassier than the XM3s, definitely a step further on that front. I happen to like bass (not muddied, just \"full\" and well-rounded), and these deliver. The highs and mids never seem to suffer either, though! A lot of it depends on fooling with your app's EQ settings, too. So don't be afraid to experiment!Great headphones and, if you have the money to splurge, they're worth it!♫/♥︎/♫","isVerified":true,"avatar":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","variant":"Color: Black","reviewImages":["https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61z9O09XrlL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61jpRBIWDnL._SY88.jpg"],"position":9},{"index":9,"productAsin":"B09XSDMT4F","username":"Blayre C.","ratingScore":5,"reviewTitle":"Yep, buy them.

These are FANTASTIC. I have used these every day since buying them 5 months ago - at the gym, at home, for work calls, etc. and they have met all my expectations. The noise canceling is fantastic, almost too good sometimes. The fit is SO comfortable and lightweight you could wear them for hours without having any ear pain (I've literally fallen asleep wearing them). I wear them to the gym to weightlift and sweat a normal amount, and have had no issues so far. Might not be something you want to do intense jumping or HIIT workouts in, since they do move around a bit - but that goes for ALL over ear headphones. Running with them on was no problem.When looking to make an investment in a pair of headphones I went in-person to Best Buy and tried these compared to the Apple Air Max and these won by a long shot. Sure, ascetically the air max's look nice and they are definitely the \"it-girl\" accessory right now but the quality of sound and the weight/comfort of these truly is just so much better. Only thing I agree with is they are a finger-print magnet but be good about cleaning your devices and its not an issue. The volume control / change song features on the ear cups is also something that takes some getting use to but I use my phone or apple watch to change those settings anyways so I don't find it to be an issue that impacts its quality.Overall, would recommend to anyone.","isVerified":true,"avatar":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","variant":"Color:

I like to think I know a little bit about sound and what it takes to reproduce sound, but the tricky thing with headphones is that everybody's' ears are different. Like, they're physically slightly different which makes every single person hear the exact same sound slightly different, but there's also our individual listening preferences too, so keep that in mind as you read this review. Personally, I prefer smooth, balanced, and LOW bass (down to 20Hz), but NOT boomy bass. I also like some sparkle in the highs (8k+).Initial impressions upon arrival and setup:- The packaging looks like it's a cheap recycled cardboard of some sort. Obviously doesn't affect the headphone's performance.- The zipable case the headphones live in also seem kinda cheap and flimsy. Again, it doesn't affect the headphone's performance.- Accessories are fairly light as it only comes with a stubby little 8\" long (seriously) USB charging cable (not even a wall adapter, just USB A to USB C) and a generic 1/8\" stereo headphone cable if you want to physically plug them into a headphone jack.- The app was easy to download, install, and update. It did require making a Sony account though, so points off for that.- Pairing the headphones to my phone and also my computer was quick and seamless. I did have to restart my computer to get Windows to send audio over the bluetooth connection, but that was an issue with Windows and not the headphones.- The headphones themselves feel of good quality and are super comfy for my average sized head.- The EQ you set in the app does persist when you connect to a different sound source. For example, the EQ curve I set on my phone was not active when I then paired the headphones to my laptop and listened to the same track.- Really needs more than 6 EQ points. Sony, you can do better than just 5 predefined sliders and a bass slider (basically 6 sliders, so IDK why the bass is separate from the rest).Listening impressions:- Best sounding headset I've purchased to date and sound MILES better than my Sennheiser HD 596 (but to be fair, those sounded ridiculously unnatural and just all-around terrible).- Plenty of \"thump\" by default, but definitely dropping off significantly below 50Hz or so, which is exactly what I like to have present in my mix. You can see I've put a HUGE boost in the low lows on my EQ curve to make things like low synths, bass drops, and sub-harmonics sound even with the rest of the sound stage. Even still, the sub-bass that is there still sounds a bit thin and artificial like they're using some processing trickery to make it sound like it's playing lower than it is (there are a few ways to do this, but they're never as authentic as just reproducing the frequency properly).- Little bit \"dark\" sounding, so a slight bump in the high mids as well as a 10k+ shelf bump really helped brighten up the sound stage.- Imaging is ok but definitely not spectacular. It's only got a single 30mm driver per ear, so that one driver is covering EVERYTHING from 20Hz to 40kHz. As such, it's expected that imaging won't be super detailed, so no surprise there. I was really hoping to see at least 2 drivers per ear. By contrast, my CCA C12 in-ear-monitors (IEM's) that I use when playing on stage are about $50 and have 6 drivers PER EAR each playing a different frequency range. Needless to say, the imaging, and extension on those IEM's is a LOT better than these headphones that cost 7x the price. Due to their small form factor, IEM's can use armature drivers where 'can' style headphones like this can't use armature drivers (not loud enough), but I would still like to see 2 dynamic drivers in these just to allow one driver to focus on the highs and the other to focus on the lows rather than having the one driver trying to play the whole shebang.- Minimal, but still present, \"pressure\" sensation when noise cancelling is on, but it's not intrusive like a lot of other ANC headphones I've tried and effectively disappears when music is playing. Having a set of ANC headphones with \"pressure\" that grabs my attention is an absolute deal-breaker for me regardless of price point.Overall, these are going to be my go-to headphone for the office. They sound good enough (especially with some EQ), and are comfy enough, to have some background music playing for hours at a time while also cancelling out loud office talkers.","isVerified":true,"variant":"Black","position":1,"title_compound_score":0.8685,"overall_sentiment":"Positive"},{"index":1,"username":"Bast","ratingScore":5,"reviewTitle":"Smaller heads, folks with hair, and sensitive temples..read this","date":"2023-01-18T00:00:00.000","country":"United States","reviewDescription":"First off, I havent had a chance to test all functionality yet. I am coming here in hopes of helping someone else out with their frustration.If you're nervous about dropping the money, do it. The app (if you let it) will track your usage. Get them, set an alert for a day or two before the return period is up. Try them out and then check your usage when the alarm goes off. If you need/use headphones I almost guarantee youre going to find these worth it.RE: Small headsYour head might not be too small. I realized after two days of use I was fitting them more like traditional headphones and they were siting on one or two lobes very slightly.When you fit, and while you get used to putting them on, I suggest:- lengthening the headand (as app suggests)- 'scooping' your ears lobes up and inside the pads rather than under them at all- then gently fitting headbandOnce I started doing this my fit issues nearly dissappeared(hair..). Biggest issue now is the band material is not grippy at all and I have very smooth/slick hair, so it wiggles a bit. If I troubleshoot around this I will update.Of note and Re:Sensitive TemplesThese do not need to be as secure over all (other than having the suction over the ears) as you will not want these to get wet, period. These are not designed for exercise or heavy movement. They are sufficiently set for walking around or hanging out, this protects you from losing suction without significant pressure on your temples and keeps these super light headphones EXTREMELY comfortable. Which for someone like me that gets migraines with nearly ANY temple pressure has been... life changing.The suction aspect for proper noise cancelation is fairly fundamental. It's an even bigger deal with these as they'll adjust sound and I could see if suction was lost at an inopportune moment it could be...uncomfortable.RE: HairY'all, your hair is going to need to be out of the way. I have already noticed that one or two small strands will absolutely affect the seal. I won't notice it immediately but when I move around or talk I'll notice a sound change (almost like a varying level of wubba womp like entering a tunnel or in elevation changes) and at the corresponding ear I'll find hair between my ear and headphones. If you experience this in one or both ears...check for anything preventing a seal! It's annoying to navigate but as with adjusting the fit as above the more I do it, the easier it is to do upfront/as second nature.The app is fairly easy to navigate but has a small learning curve, nothing atronimical. The only other app ive used for headphones was Jabra about 2 years ago. Theyve likely updated since but compared to the 2020 Jabra app..this app is night and day better in terms of navigation and ease of use.So far my only con has been switching between my TV and my phone. This could be me, I think this may just be a learning curve I havent yet had time to solve. What it was doing: Paired to both. Switched to phone to do some Duolingo. For some reason any adjustment i made unpaused my TV and swapped where the sound was coming from. When I re-paused my TV I'd have to reselect my phone..and then it would do this again. So for now Im just leaving the TV unpaired. I mostly dont need this anyway but thought it might be nice for my neighbors late at night.Summation without even talking about its sound quality, noise cancelation and other functions (which are amazing):These headphones are worth the price tag for the lack of weight on my temples ALONE. Everything else is  icing on the cake.If something changes I will absolutely return here to update.","isVerified":true,"variant":"Black","position":2,"title_compound_score":0,"overall_sentiment":"Neutral"},{"index":2,"username":"Richard HuynhRichard Huynh","ratingScore":5,"reviewTitle":"Sony never disappoints!","date":"2022-11-24T00:00:00.000","country":"United States","reviewDescription":"I thoroughly enjoy what Sony has to offer in their product line. I have the PlayStation 5, a Sony Bravia 4K TV and several other Sony products. Yes although I have owned a few of their product line I will not try to be biased here with the review. What got me into Sony products was really their earphones dating back to 2011! They have the best earphones you could get for $20 back at the time in 2011 and now the quality they still continue to put out never disappoints! Here's the pros and cons of the Sony WH-1000XM5.Update: I also picked up the XM4 Earbuds from Sony and take note that those are on a different level for listening to music compared to the XM5 Over the Ear headphones. Shares the same features like the XM5, not the same sound like over the ear obviously but also more marketed to those who goes to the gym and likes something more compact.Pros:Comfortable and lightweight!I don't ever have a complaint with what they have to offer when it comes to comfort. These are better than BOSE in regards as to comfort. I think the one thing that makes them comfortable also is that they are light. They weigh only about 0.56 pounds! People tend to have problems with headphones if they are heavy in my opinion! I also assume they use a low density memory foam for cushioning which is great but will eventually need to be replaced or tended to if left compressed or squished for too long.Unique featuresNoise Cancelling is top notch but not much different than their previous lines in my opinion! It is a standard these days to get noise cancelling and the headphones are great for drowning out noise if need be. They also tend to those who need to be aware of their surroundings by implementing a ambient mode like previous models. Works great and works like a charm by either taking the headphones off or covering the touch control panel. Also the Speak to Pause Music feature is insanely nice to have! Helps when your hands are busy and or you just don't want to adjust your headphones having to speak.Superb sound!The sound quality out of these are amazing! Does really well in all areas of music genres. Particularly really in low frequencies for bass! I get to enjoy these at a great volume and it pairs amazingly with my PS5 as a gaming headset! (Will mention the headphones does not come with a microphone for gaming when using a headphone jack.) As a pair of noise cancelling headphones, you can expect to hear a positively good detail in music, movies, gaming or even a phone call! They are clear and surprisingly really balanced. The microphone on these headphones for phone calls are great. Better than the previous versions.Fast charging!The charging rate of these headphones is incredible! I never knew how fast charging can be with this! There's times I have left this powered on overnight as I'm at work for my 10 hour job and it was drained by the time I wanted to use it again. In those times I left it charging and goodness greatness these were ready to go in a about 10-15 minutes!  I enjoy these so much that I'm actually glad they have a 24-30 hour battery life.Cons:Cost.Its expensive! If you can get these on sale, it's worthwhile! If it's in your budget go for it! You pay for what you get in my opinion and these are worth their weight in gold!Fitment.They don't exactly fit around my short wide neck whenever I need to take it off and be present in a conversation or in my surroundings. Not exactly a big matter or deal breaker. More so it's a personal perspective. My neck size is 15 ¾ inches in circumference and that's pretty average I believe. I have to extend these in order to keep them around my neck without compromise. They also do not fold inward like the previous Sony headphone models but again never a issue.Cushion. Yes the ear cup cushions are comfortable but again when I place them around my neck it compresses the cushion to a point where it feels awkward after putting it back on. I'm looking at other options to replace their soft fit leather design.Update: There is different earcups that you can replace the OEM cups with but it comes at a cost of I believe $60 which is worth noting.Conclusion.Worthiness of $350+ (price as of 12/07/2022) during the holidays? Yes!Personal opinionated review:Sony WH-1000XM5 or other leading competition? Sony, easily Sony. I've never been unhappy about this purchase and I tell people that Sony is industrial leading company that continues to impress people when it comes to their headphones. Beats by Dre(Apple), Apple and Bose has always been great by popularity but Sony gets appraised by quality!I will update this review as I go until they put a new model out.","isVerified":true,"variant":"Black","position":3,"title_compound_score":0.3561,"overall_sentiment":"Positive"},{"index":3,"username":"mhans311","ratingScore":4,"reviewTitle":"Comparison to Bose NC700","date":"2023-02-04T00:00:00.000","country":"United States","reviewDescription":"I have used Bose NC700 for the past year, but saw these on sale for a great price and decided to try them. I had the XM4’s for a short time but had to return them because they were too creaky while wearing them. Luckily I have not had that same issue so far with the XM5’s. My biggest priorities for headphones is comfort, sound quality (both for music and phone calls), and noise cancellation.ComfortThe XM5’s have ear cups that are slightly larger than the XM4s and they also look slightly larger than the NC700s. This helps them go over the ears better. However, the NC700s have slightly thicker padding which makes the inside of the cup a little deeper. For this reason, I would say that the NC700s are a bit more comfortable for long periods. The XM5s are very comfortable, but after a couple of hours, I definitely start to feel them more than the NC700s. But both are great.Sound QualityThis is a matter of preference, but I prefer the deeper bass and fuller sound of the XM5s. I would say the NC700s have a more balanced sound, with far less low end. The XM5s really give a nice full bass, without it being over-bearing. I do prefer a bit more lower end than what the Bose provides. So for me, I prefer the sound quality of the XM5s quite a bit more than the NC700s.Call QualityI use my headphones for work calls several hours a day. Both the XM5 and the NC700 have great call quality and will work really well if you use them for phone calls or Zoom meetings a lot. I think I’d give the edge to the XM5s because they block out ambient noise slightly better than the NC700s, but the difference is negligible.Noise CancellationI mean, these are high end headphones and both do a great job with noise cancellation. I will say, I was surprised at how much noise the XM5s can block out. They block out voices and medium pitched noises better than the NC700s. They are both great with lower pitched things like plane noise. But I think the XM5s do a better job overall.Build Quality and DesignThis is where the Bose NC700s are just better than the XM5s. The build of the NC700s is just beautiful. They feel substantial without being too heavy, and there isn’t a seam anywhere. I also think they just look amazing. The XM5s do have seams around the ear cups and they feel much more plasticky. The XM5s are not bad, but they just are not as good as the NC700s as far as design and build quality.Battery LifeThe battery on the NC700 lasts me around 13 or 14 hours. The XM5s last around 25 hours. So it’s a pretty big difference. Charging speed seems about the same with both.Odds and EndsFeatures of each are similar. They both offer pass through audio and it works well on both. Touch controls work equally well on both. The case of the XM5s is a little bigger than the NC700s, if that matters to you. One small difference that may make a difference to some is that if you want to use the cord to plug them into a 3.5mm headphone jack, the end the plugs into the NC700s is 2.5mm. So if you lose the included cord, you will need a specific type of aux cord to replace it (2.5mm to 3.5mm). Whereas the XM5 uses a regular 3.5mm to 3.5mm aux cord.Overall I do like these Sonys better. I just wish they had the comfort and build quality of the Bose. But because of the superior noise cancellation and sound quality, I’m going to be using the Sonys from now on.","isVerified":true,"variant":"Silver","position":4,"title_compound_score":0,"overall_sentiment":"Neutral"},{"index":4,"username":"Fresh and Felicia","ratingScore":5,"reviewTitle":"UNBELIEVABLE carbon fiber sound quality, improved ANC with 2 processors and 8 improved mics","date":"2022-05-24T00:00:00.000","country":"United States","reviewDescription":"I own Sony’s WH-1000 XM4s and the Bose 700s, two of the leading models in the industry. I had AirPods Max for a minute, but I rage-sold them. To me, the Sony and Bose are both awesome headsets. So I was psyched to hear Sony was releasing XM5s. Summer’s here, and these can get a little hot on hot days outdoors. It’s like wearing earmuffs on the beach. But, if you can get past a little sweaty ears, or if you use them indoors or on airplanes, you should be a little excited.The Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones feature, what Sony advertises, “industry-leading noise cancellation.” And they ain’t lyin. With Bluetooth 5.2 and Sony's QN1 and V1 chips, the XM5s have DUAL processors - compared to the lonely single processor of the XM4. These two processors control 8 microphones for crazy accurate noise cancellation. Think - a little computer actually sampling noise from fans, airplane engines, air conditioners, motors, and consistent noise like that  - and creates an identical but perfect opposite wave, so they kinda cancel each other out. And this time, the dual processors are capable of filtering higher frequency sounds, including some voices. It’s pretty cool tech. The first time you hear this, it’s like magic! In my video review, you can see my personal reaction.With the XM5s, noise canceling is automatically optimized based on your wearing conditions and environment. You don’t have to do anything. It knows if you’re sitting, walking, in an airplane, et cetera.No, noise reduction probably won’t completely cancel a very loud angry spouse, or a crying baby. But the over the ear closed design may help dull annoying sounds.A very small cadre of people claim they become nauseous using noise cancelling headphones, and especially the old model XM4s. I’ve never experienced this personally, but be aware it could happen. You can disable it if you need to. Some people thought the WH-1000XM4s were too snug. I thought they felt great, but they’ve improved the fit with a  new lightweight design with soft-fit leather. This material fits snugly but with less pressure on your ears while still keeping out the external sounds you don’t want to hear.There were a few other design changes – the XM5s aren’t foldable like the XM4s, and there’s a redesigned case that’s collapsible to save room in your bag when you’re wearing your headphones.With up to 30 hours of battery life, you’ll have enough power to travel halfway to the moon in one of Elon Musk’s rockets. But, in case you forgot to charge and you’re in a hurry, you can get 3 hours' worth of charge after just 3 minutes with an optional AC adapter.And unfortunately, the in-flight plug adapter is not included in the supplied accessories this time. But who uses that anyway? That’s so old school! Fortunately, there still is an aux-in for you old-school holdouts.The touch controls survived, where you can pause/play/skip tracks, control volume, activate your voice assistant, and answer phone calls. And the speak to chat lives also, where as soon as you start a conversation, Speak-to-Chat automatically stops your music and lets in ambient sound. And wear detection knows when you take them off.But – how do they sound?Sony has popped new, more rigid, 30mm carbon fiber drivers in the XM5s. They have more of an audiophile sound profile with slightly more balanced sound, better clarity, and more accurate bass. That’s important if you listen to real music, you know, with actual instruments, like rock, jazz, r and b, country, classical, and music like that. The XM4s have 40mm drivers, which will probably be better for hip-hop. The XM5s will reproduce hip-hop very accurately, meaning the way the studio producer intended you to hear it, but they probably won’t have the head-vibrating tinnitus-inducing bass many people want. TBH that's hard to find in any headphone due to physics.The XM5s support LDAC and spatial 3D audio, whatever that is, and they have also upgraded their Sony Music Studios Edge-AI music algorithm, which somehow magically guesses what musical dynamics were lost during compression and tries to replace that, so everything sounds crisp and clean without losing the bass that’s necessary in most of today’s popular music.I have heard some folks claimed the MX4s sounded “muddy” with some music. I didn’t notice that, but I’m a producer and I’m familiar with equalization. There are about 20 presets including several you can create yourself.And even without the Qualcomm APTX Low Latency chip, both my XM4s and XM5s allowed me to watch a complete movie on Netflix on my 2022 Samsung Frame television, wirelessly, from 10-plus feet away, with ZERO loss in mouth synchronization. Plus, like my XM4s, the XM5s still have dual Bluetooth pairing so you can pair them with two devices at the same time and switch back and forth between them. It's a pretty cool feature if you use them for your phone, but also want to use them to watch YouTube videos at work on your computer. But, you probably shouldn’t tell your boss about that.And the XM5s work with Google Assist, Alexa, and Siri. You can even set up Spotify playback with a few taps. Try that on your Air Pods Max.The big win seems to be a vast improvement in the sound of your voice during phone calls quality. They’re actually impressive when it comes to calling in louder rooms. I’ve made test calls on busy streets and on windy sidewalks, and my call-ee said she couldn’t tell I was actually outdoors. Apparently, the four beam-forming microphones and the dual-processor software can recognize your voice and somehow block a lot of background noise. I mean, you can still probably hear tire screeches, gunshots, and car alarms, things you’ll typically hear in the city. But a lot of the noise is just gone. Like magic!Oh – and there’s Speak to Chat. You start speaking, and the XM5s automatically adjust noise cancellation to pick up the voices of other people. No buttons, no fumbling with your phone. That’s a pretty cool feature.So are they worth the upgrade? If you have XM4s and you think your call quality is shaky, then grab some XM5s and sell your sweaty old XM4s on Craigslist. If you’re moving from Bose's Noise Canceling 700 or QuietComfort 45s, the new dual processors and 8 microphone array will provide some noticeable improvements, plus the dual Bluetooth sync, so they’re probably worth looking into. If you’re done with your Air Pods Max and prefer better compatibility with non-Apple stuff including android phones, PCs, and Sony or Samsung Smart TVs, it’s a no-brainer.","isVerified":true,"variant":"Black","position":5,"title_compound_score":0.8286,"overall_sentiment":"Positive"},{"index":5,"username":"Worm","ratingScore":4,"reviewTitle":"It’s not 100% Noise Cancellation","date":"2023-01-16T00:00:00.000","country":"United States","reviewDescription":"If you want 100% Noise Cancellation, use ear plugs that are made for it not a pair of Bluetooth Headphones. Does it work great if you’re playing music or something, yeah. Having Noise Cancellation with music playing does help focus more on the songs. I wouldn’t rate the “Surround Sound”/360 audio as mind blowing, but it does the job. That being said, it’s amazing how clear some sounds can be, such as in Call of Duty… or Minecraft. Zero disappointment if you want clear audio since the ear cushion works wonders (Not sure how long they will last though). As for charging and using the audio Jack at the same time since Bluetooth doesn’t work while it’s charging, I found it a horrible experience. Just get a good charging brick, a decent length usb-c cable and charge the thing once it reaches 20%. Go eat, take a walk or do it in your sleep but that battery wasn’t lying about being able to reach 30 hours. Though I would only limit it to 20-24 hours before checking the battery limit by pressing the power button again and hearing it tell you the power level. I don’t plan on killing the battery health and you should too for this price point. As for the range, Bluetooth 5 is impeccable especially with a quality device and limited walls between you, your pc and the kitchen. As for volume control, it changes it by small increment, though holding on to the right pad with your palm does activate transparency mode and lower the volume so you can hear someone talk. Downloading the app will show you a few things btw. It’s just a little overpriced by maybe $80 bucks, but you can’t deny the microphone quality. It’s quite good on mobile but if you use OBS to record there is always that noise. That being said, it does isolate my voice quite well in a loud environment and the Noise Cancellation keeps me from hearing anyone talk though to how high I have the volume playing my content to immerse myself. But like I said, without any content playing you can still hear stuff through the noise cancellation but once you play something else on top it’s gold. If there was once feature they should’ve added it would be dual control on both ear cuffs instead of just the right. I’m not left handed but it would increase usability since I don’t always get the action I want done though to me lying down or whatnot and my hand gesture was a little off from the four main directions. Also can we get a PC App or settings? I hate having to use my phone to change a few things such as the level of noise cancellation or shutting off/on the gesture control. There are times when I forget to turn them back on and when I switch to PC/Mac I have to go back to my phone to turn those controls back on. If there is a desktop App, me not so bright. That being said, it’s a good product, just a tad overpriced. Let’s see how long I can keep it alive.","isVerified":true,"variant":"Black","position":6,"title_compound_score":0,"overall_sentiment":"Neutral"},{"index":6,"username":"Laurent Park","ratingScore":4,"reviewTitle":"Incredibly comfortable and versatile headphones. Okay sound.","date":"2023-02-04T00:00:00.000","country":"United States","reviewDescription":"I got this looking for a replacement for my AirPod Pros -- I would use them for work calls and for listening. My airpods were great for comfort,, but terrible for a full day of work, and the mic quality was not great for call applications that I use.So I did some research between these headphones and other over-ear headphones like AirPod Maxes, Bose QC. I was mainly deciding between these and the AirPods since I use entirely Apple devices and went with the Sony's for price and supposedly good comfort.So here are my pros/cons after about 3 months with these:Pros:- I have a huge head and I generally have stayed away from over ear headphones for long periods of listening. These are inarguably the most comfortable headphones I have ever used. I am able to last a full 8 hour office job wearing these without too much sweat or heat, and the pressure is perfect. No headaches from wearing them all day, and it's overall been absolutely perfect. In comparison to the AirPods maxes (that I used for a day from my partner) that gave me an incredibly painful headache from the pressure after an hour of use.- Battery life / charging is amazing. 30 hours may be the industry standard but whenever I'm low, I just give it a charge for five minutes and I'm basically good for the next few hours.Cons:- I listen to a variety of music from hip hop and mostly electronic music. For songs with more emphasis on acoustics and vocals, the headphones are pretty good. However for my electronic library it leaves a bit to be desired. The bass and sometimes mids feel very muddy, and no amount of EQ I use can get it to where I like for all my music. This is where AirPods Maxes shine out. They may be 200$ more but they are inarguably better sounding with their adaptive EQ.- Not really at any fault of Sony's, but if you use Apple products you can't use the LDAC codec at all. You are missing out on a better sound quality on Apple, and can only really use LDAC with Android.","isVerified":true,"variant":"Silver","position":7,"title_compound_score":0.6697,"overall_sentiment":"Positive"},{"index":7,"username":"Miki Villarreal","ratingScore":5,"reviewTitle":"I have fallen in love","date":"2022-12-21T00:00:00.000","country":"United States","reviewDescription":"I have been looking for some good over the ear headphones and seen so many good reviews of these. I decided to try them out and these are some amazing head phones! I recently had to travel and ended up wearing them for 6 hours straight!Battery life: The battery was full and by the end of my travel it dropped to 85% so the battery life is outstanding.Noise cancellation: It was really good and didn’t create too much pressure while on. Even when the headphones were off it did an amazing job of damping outside noise. Ex: I was by a VERY loud construction site and once I put on the headphones (turned off) it almost dampened the noise completely.Ambient Mode: It’s nice, I will say that in some cases I didn’t really use it. For example if you are in a loud environment it will be extremely loud while on. Which makes sense as the point of AMB is to be aware of your surroundings but if you have sensory issues I would be mindful of it. When you do the quick ambient sound it’s really good and makes what you need to hear very clear. There is very little static noise but if you are listening closely it’s very faint.Comfort: These are so comfortable and lightweight. Part of the reason I was having difficulty choosing over the ear headphones was because many were too heavy for my liking but when I wore these I forgot I had them on. I only had to adjust them once when it hit closer to the 5 hour mark. There is very little discomfort. My only thing is being that they are so light it feels like they can slip off easily sometimes. When you have them laying on your neck it can be a little uncomfortable at least for me. They landed on my collarbones so there was just hard plastic hitting my collarbones over a bit of time. But that is just me nit picking.Few set backs: the storage of them is a little inconvenient or undesirable. I wish these could fold because the case is quite large and take ups a lot of space especially when you are traveling.Overall: I have really enjoyed the experience with these headphones! I would really recommend these to someone who has auditory sensitivity like myself because they check a lot of boxes! There are only a few things that I wasn’t a huge fan of but that was like I said me nit picking.A video that was very helpful in making this decision was by: This is Tech Today on YouTube, they really went in-depth of all the features while also comparing it to different nc/amb headphones!","isVerified":true,"variant":"Silver","position":8,"title_compound_score":0.4019,"overall_sentiment":"Positive"},{"index":8,"username":"Brandi J.","ratingScore":5,"reviewTitle":"The best headphones I've ever owned","date":"2023-02-01T00:00:00.000","country":"United States","reviewDescription":"I went ahead and splurged on these around 3 to 6 months ago after I stepped on my XM3s in the dark and cracked the band mechanism. I do not regret my purchase at all; these cans produce such rich and full-bodied bass-enhanced sound that I can't leave a room in my house without bringing them with me.. in case I need awesome music for a bit.Funny story.. I thought the noise-canceling was just kind of mediocre this whole time, especially when I was flying back from visiting my parents and using them on a plane. The trick is to quickly press the second button toward the back on the left earpiece to activate noise-canceling. It was like the angels sang when I did that.. suddenly the music was so clear and rich, the plane noises virtually eliminated. Duh. So if you own these or are thinking about it, don't forget that tip!As I mentioned, I've owned the older XM3 model for quite a few years now and loved them; these XM5s are even better and I love them for all music listening occasions. They're a little bassier than the XM3s, definitely a step further on that front. I happen to like bass (not muddied, just \"full\" and well-rounded), and these deliver. The highs and mids never seem to suffer either, though! A lot of it depends on fooling with your app's EQ settings, too. So don't be afraid to experiment!Great headphones and, if you have the money to splurge, they're worth it!♫/♥︎/♫","isVerified":true,"variant":"Black","position":9,"title_compound_score":0.6369,"overall_sentiment":"Positive"},{"index":9,"username":"Blayre C.","ratingScore":5,"reviewTitle":"Yep, buy them.

These are FANTASTIC. I have used these every day since buying them 5 months ago - at the gym, at home, for work calls, etc. and they have met all my expectations. The noise canceling is fantastic, almost too good sometimes. The fit is SO comfortable and lightweight you could wear them for hours without having any ear pain (I've literally fallen asleep wearing them). I wear them to the gym to weightlift and sweat a normal amount, and have had no issues so far. Might not be something you want to do intense jumping or HIIT workouts in, since they do move around a bit - but that goes for ALL over ear headphones. Running with them on was no problem.When looking to make an investment in a pair of headphones I went in-person to Best Buy and tried these compared to the Apple Air Max and these won by a long shot. Sure, ascetically the air max's look nice and they are definitely the \"it-girl\" accessory right now but the quality of sound and the weight/comfort of these truly is just so much better. Only thing I agree with is they are a finger-print magnet but be good about cleaning your devices and its not an issue. The volume control / change song features on the ear cups is also something that takes some getting use to but I use my phone or apple watch to change those settings anyways so I don't find it to be an issue that impacts its quality.Overall, would recommend to anyone.","isVerified":true,"variant":"Black","position":10,"title_compound_score":0.296,"overall_sentiment":"Positive"}]},"total_rows":10,"truncation_type":null},"text/plain":"                     username  ...  overall_sentiment\n0                      kcdkcd  ...

a hobbyist musician and sound engineer of 20 years and also mild audiophile that builds my own speakers.","I like to think I know a little bit about sound and what it takes to reproduce sound, but the tricky thing with headphones is that everybody's' ears are different.","Like, they're physically slightly different which makes every single person hear the exact same sound slightly different, but there's also our individual listening preferences too, so keep that in mind as you read this review.","I did have to restart my computer to get Windows to send audio over the bluetooth connection, but that was an issue with Windows and not the headphones.- The headphones themselves feel of good quality and are super comfy for my average sized head.- The EQ you set in the app does persist when you connect to a different sound source.","Sony, you can do better than just 5 predefined sliders and a bass slider (basically 6 sliders, so IDK why the bass is separate from the rest).Listening impressions:- Best sounding headset I've purchased to date and sound MILES better than my Sennheiser HD 596 (but to be fair, those sounded ridiculously unnatural and just all-around terrible).- Plenty of \"thump\" by default, but definitely dropping off significantly below 50Hz or so, which is exactly what I like to have present in my mix.","You can see I've put a HUGE boost in the low lows on my EQ curve to make things like low synths, bass drops, and sub-harmonics sound even with the rest of the sound stage.","Even still, the sub-bass that is there still sounds a bit thin and artificial like they're using some processing trickery to make it sound like it's playing lower than it is (there are a few ways to do this, but they're never as authentic as just reproducing the frequency properly).- Little bit \"dark\" sounding, so a slight bump in the high mids as well as a 10k+ shelf bump really helped brighten up the sound stage.- Imaging is ok but definitely not spectacular.","They sound good enough (especially with some EQ), and are comfy enough, to have some background music playing for hours at a time while also cancelling out loud office talkers.","It's an even bigger deal with these as they'll adjust sound and I could see if suction was lost at an inopportune moment it could be...uncomfortable.RE: HairY'all, your hair is going to need to be out of the way.","I won't notice it immediately but when I move around or talk I'll notice a sound change (almost like a varying level of wubba womp like entering a tunnel or in elevation changes) and at the corresponding ear I'll find hair between my ear and headphones.","For some reason any adjustment i made unpaused my TV and swapped where the sound was coming from.","I mostly dont need this anyway but thought it might be nice for my neighbors late at night.Summation without even talking about its sound quality, noise cancelation and other functions (which are amazing):These headphones are worth the price tag for the lack of weight on my temples ALONE.","Shares the same features like the XM5, not the same sound like over the ear obviously but also more marketed to those who goes to the gym and likes something more compact.Pros:Comfortable and lightweight!I don't ever have a complaint with what they have to offer when it comes to comfort.","Helps when your hands are busy and or you just don't want to adjust your headphones having to speak.Superb sound!The sound quality out of these are amazing!","My biggest priorities for headphones is comfort, sound quality (both for music and phone calls), and noise cancellation.ComfortThe XM5’s have ear cups that are slightly larger than the XM4s and they also look slightly larger than the NC700s.","But both are great.Sound QualityThis is a matter of preference, but I prefer the deeper bass and fuller sound of the XM5s.","I would say the NC700s have a more balanced sound, with far less low end.","So for me, I prefer the sound quality of the XM5s quite a bit more than the NC700s.Call QualityI use my headphones for work calls several hours a day.","But because of the superior noise cancellation and sound quality, I’m going to be using the Sonys from now on.","And this time, the dual processors are capable of filtering higher frequency sounds, including some voices.","But the over the ear closed design may help dull annoying sounds.A very small cadre of people claim they become nauseous using noise cancelling headphones, and especially the old model XM4s.","This material fits snugly but with less pressure on your ears while still keeping out the external sounds you don’t want to hear.There were a few other design changes – the XM5s aren’t foldable like the XM4s, and there’s a redesigned case that’s collapsible to save room in your bag when you’re wearing your headphones.With up to 30 hours of battery life, you’ll have enough power to travel halfway to the moon in one of Elon Musk’s rockets.","And the speak to chat lives also, where as soon as you start a conversation, Speak-to-Chat automatically stops your music and lets in ambient sound.","And wear detection knows when you take them off.But – how do they sound?Sony has popped new, more rigid, 30mm carbon fiber drivers in the XM5s.","They have more of an audiophile sound profile with slightly more balanced sound, better clarity, and more accurate bass.","TBH that's hard to find in any headphone due to physics.The XM5s support LDAC and spatial 3D audio, whatever that is, and they have also upgraded their Sony Music Studios Edge-AI music algorithm, which somehow magically guesses what musical dynamics were lost during compression and tries to replace that, so everything sounds crisp and clean without losing the bass that’s necessary in most of today’s popular music.I have heard some folks claimed the MX4s sounded “muddy” with some music.","Try that on your Air Pods Max.The big win seems to be a vast improvement in the sound of your voice during phone calls quality.","I wouldn’t rate the “Surround Sound”/360 audio as mind blowing, but it does the job.","That being said, it’s amazing how clear some sounds can be, such as in Call of Duty… or Minecraft.","They may be 200$ more but they are inarguably better sounding with their adaptive EQ.- Not really at any fault of Sony's, but if you use Apple products you can't use the LDAC codec at all.","You are missing out on a better sound quality on Apple, and can only really use LDAC with Android.","When you do the quick ambient sound it’s really good and makes what you need to hear very clear.","I do not regret my purchase at all; these cans produce such rich and full-bodied bass-enhanced sound that I can't leave a room in my house without bringing them with me.. in case I need awesome music for a bit.Funny story..","Sure, ascetically the air max's look nice and they are definitely the \"it-girl\" accessory right now but the quality of sound and the weight/comfort of these truly is just so much better.","For reference, I'm an Asian male with a slightly bigger ears and head.SOUND 5/5I'm really impressed that these produce fuller sound out of box.","My last Bose headphones provide good neutral sound and can be easier on ears but Sony's headphones are much more enjoyable for most songs.ANC 5/5I live in California so most times at home I have a fan blowing at me not 2 feet away.","But as soon as you cover the right ear cup, it switches to ambient sound right away.BATTERY 4/5The device advertises it has 30 hours.","As soon as I play something on one device when there is no sound playing in another, it switches to the active device.","And there is no delay in switching to ambient sound when right ear cup is covered and switching back to whatever mode or ANC when it is uncovered.PORTABILITY 3/5They no longer can be folded and their case is bulkier.","He loves the sound quality,  battery life, the sound quality, ability to block or allow surrounding sound,  the sound quality, the durable feel, the sound quality, the range, and did I mention the sound quality.","I knew these would sound great because I work in A/V and they're very highly regarded.","But wow, I can't believe how amazing they sound: the frequency response and stereo imaging are unlike anything I've heard.","The Bose QC35’s will do that too, but not nearly as much, but the MX5 is quieter and sounds a little better than the Bose QC35’s and 700’s.","Sorry again, Bose.I won't go detail about the sound quality like mid-tone, bass and other stuff because you can just watch review on YouTube.","But I personally like sound on the Bose NC 700 more, just slightly more.For stylish, it looks OK, like an average headphone.","Noise cancellation isn't as great as the AirPods Max and neither transparency, but the sound quality was a little better in my opinion.","Going to these headphones these were much more comfortable for a longer sessions, which to me alone is worth the extra spending on these headphones.They're slightly better sound-wise than the xm4's but it's not anything most people would notice.","As you expect with sony's these are the top tier in terms of immersion in other environments, so much so to a point that I actually had these on at one point during an after-service dinner party just for the noise canceling to muffle out the sound of the music being played, as I had a headache at the time.","Superior sound, easy to use app and overall awesome value.","The headphone is very comfortable and the quality of sound is very clean and sharp","For the price you get a durable, Great sound quality audio device.","I found this to be a huge let down and was even more annoyed I needed these myriad of apps to utilize a huge selling feature of the headphones.Besides the compatibly issue the headphones were amazing: great design, amazing audio, and great battery life yet, ultimately for me it’s overly complicated ways and hoops to jump through as an Apple user is what steered me away here.I instead bought the Apple AirPods Max, equally great sound quality, superior design, and elite performance, plus they are insanely and easily comparable with every thing Apple which was a huge selling point for me.","Amazing sound quality, easy to turn on/off the noise cancellation.","If you only care about sound quality though, you may want to look elsewhere.","My previous daily driver was a pair of Sennheiser HD58x Jubilees (paired with a Qudelix 5k cause rip the headphone jack) and they sounded amazing, arguably better than these headphones at a lower price, that's including the receiver.","You get better battery sure, but for some reason the cans amplify whatever ambient noise is around you and make them very echo-y/muddy and yes, I made sure it wasn't set to the pass through mode) It's almost like you are in a void and it doesn't negatively affect sound quality by a noticeable margin.For whatever reason you can't use the usb cable to pass through audio so your two options are bluetooth and aux.","High frequencies sound like absolute trash through aux and the bass loses its thump.","Not only do they sound great, have great noise canceling, are crystal clear for phone calls, and give solid performance for those late night gaming sessions but they are so light and comfortable you hardly notice that you have them on.","The quality of the music sounds really good but I haven’t used many headphones other than the koss headphones but i love them and do think they sound really good.","The sound quality is awesome though.","If you need more compact headphones, I would recommend the Sennheiser Momentum 3, which also sounds excellent and has a brighter sound signature.","However, its the 700s would also lose the adjustment very easily compared to the MX5s when moving around because they rubbed against a headrest.Noise CancellingI won't focus on the sound quality because I am not an audiophile.","Once sounds stops on one device the second device starts playing right away.","The same button can also turn off/on noise cancelling but rather the headphones given a verbal sentence like \"Noise Cancelling 5\" to let me that I am in ambient sound mode.","I need to learn the sound of 3 different tones.","They’re lightweight, they look nice, the sound quality is nice, and the noise cancellation is amazing.","I use them primarily to listen to vinyl records and the sound is incredible.","You can download the song headphone app to adjust bass treble etc also but I think the balance and brightness of sound is perfect as is.","First, they fit perfectly over my ears and are so comfortableSecond,  The sound quality is awesome.","sound quality is good.3.","Win-win!Out of the box, the sound quality on these cans is decent but the headphones are more bass-heavy.","The low end sounds a little “muddy”.","We'd rather rather live with the just-tolerable sound profile than give up all that information to Sony.","The sound quality is amazing.","The separation and sound staging are quite precise I'd say, and with the app you can have practically unlimited bass while still maintaining crisp, prominent highs, that do not interrupt or drown out the mids.","These headphones are built for every genre of music BECAUSE they're so precise and customizable as far as sound goes.","That's a massive plus, interpreting a song differently because you changed the way it sounded.","The smaller drivers do not in any way take from the sound quality.","They sound like quality headphones, and the volume control is consistent.","The sound quality does not change until about maybe 90-100%.","Your preference in sound can be a lot more precise using these headphones.","Maybe movies..and YouTube..and Game of Thrones..you get the point.The sound quality in these is best described as, adequate...though mostly bordering on dismal.","Almost the exact sound profile as Sony's XB (extra bass) series of headphones.","The treble rolls off too soon, leaving you with a sound best described as \"under a wet blanket\".","Almost all of these features can be had in the 900 and 700 series, for much less money, and roughly the same sound quality.","Heck, even the older XM4's sound roughly the same for WAAAY less money.","No, what I'm pointing out is that for a 1000 series, the best of the best, the highest you can go, the most expensive ANC headphones Sony makes, they should -at least- have drivers in them that sound decent.","The sound is really good, very pleasing to the ears.","But then again, the sound is far superior.","Sound quality was great, noise cancelling was solid, and initially battery life was fantastic.","I need mine to see what I’m working on, and just moving my head around would make a creaking sound very similar to how old floorboards sound.","The sound was punchy and accurate.","Very disappointed to find that neither Sonys top televisions nor Sonys ps5 are natively compatible with these… you’ll need to expect to have to make a separate purchase for wireless dongle(s) for anything other than your cell phone or laptop… alternatively you can wire the wireless headphones, but from my experience, they lose all sound quality when wired direct (ps5 3.5mm)… so if you think you may watch / play ps5 at night while the Mrs is sleeping, what you’ll get is a wire to the ps5 remote and mono-stereo sound… in other words, when using with a ps5 or Sonys top 80/90 series oLED TVs… they’re about as good as a $5.00 pair of headphones from the dollar store… when paired to a phone / laptop they’re excellent… but imo, they’re way way way WAAAAAAYYYYYY overpriced to not be compatible with top end Sony products….",")**edit**Also not compatible with Sony Bluetooth sound barAlso not compatible with low latency dongle(FYI previous versions were low latency codec)Also lacks any IP rating, if you wear these in sunlight and get sweaty, kiss them goodbye","Other than that, the sound quality is not even half of what you get with an airpods pro, big sound leakage, noise cancellation is also similar to airpods pro.","The sound quality and build quality are wonderful.","it looks great, sounds really welll justr needs an eq balance.","Everyone says i sound clear and it picks up so much.","I may have to bring my ANC ear buds, as I don't think I can tolerate these headphones for more than a couple of hours.The sound quality was disappointing to me.","Continues on a bit of a muddy sound like the previous models, however the noise cancelling is superb and EQ options such as the custom Wavelet profile from soundguys make this an incredible all around headphone.Edit: After owning this for a few days I've noticed some issues.","This is likely due to the (probably) low density foam used, and could be detrimental to sound quality in the long term.Edit 3: Accidentally put a little too much force when squeezing these into a bag, the bracket held to the band by a single screw and some adhesive kinda just fell apart.","Much better sounding than my Airpod Max.","The noice cancellation and ambient sounds are top notch.","The sound is the best part.","I suggest using Mogami headphones cable to the get the overall best quality sound.","Better off getting a sound bar or AV receiver for the same price.","Music sounds really good especially if you mess with the EQ.","These sound ok.","Personally like the sound from older Bose 700 model.","Sound and build quality is stellar.","Wanted to upgrade but A/B testing still had my 1000XM2’s feeling and sounding better then these.","The sound quality is outstanding to my ears and I listen to a lot of classical music where it is easy to notice any performance issues.","Callers report hearing me from far away and crackling sound, just like the other Sony modelSony WH-1000XM4.","I really wanted to keep these because the sound is AMAZING.","No more creaking sounds since it doesn't fold, which sucks.","If you, like me, like to wear these headphones just to cancel sound and not play anything, you'll notice the auto ANC working it's magic.","Best pair of ANC headphones I've ever used overall in terms of sound quality, materials used, weight on head and styling.","Sound quality is good but I feel my old Bose QC35’s were just as good and had similar if not better NC.","Great noise canceling and sound, but I would not wear them for a long time because the earcups feel too hot.","Easily the best headphones I have ever owned.Pros:Best sound for the priceNice EQ settings (could be more advanced though)Clean & Modern DesignTop tier ANC (Noice Cancellation) (better than Airpod Max)Cons:Not as portable as XM4'sNot quite as padded as XM4, but still very comfortable to me (this is subjective)Pass through is not quite as good as Airpod Max (but remember ANC is better on XM5s)","Can confirm that the sound is great, noise cancellation is great, but I just could not wear these for more than an hour.","The XM5’s have a much crisper sound, great bass, great mics and are much more comfortable than the XM4’s!","The pressure from the noise cancelling can cause me headaches, so i end up not using it much, the sound quality is good, but my biggest dissapointment is THEY ARE NOT LOUD.","Tried looking up ways to try and make them louder, hooked up the cord to my phone and headphones and the sound quality immediately dropped and they are STILL not loud.","Now i’m stuck with the headphones and trying to figure out a way to get rid of them to get a set that actually encompasses what headphones are supposed to do as far as sound volume and quality.","I have the XM4's and these sound quite a bit different, but not necessarily in a good way.","I'm not sure if mine are defective as I'm not getting the 'sounds better than then XM4' vibes like nearly everyone else.","These, or the XM4's, have no water resistance.Anyway, I will try these with different DAC's and even the new Sony Walkman to see if sound quality gets better.","As far as the muffled sound, maybe there's a break in period.My quick verdict would be to save your money if you already own some XM4's.","Just don't expect the sound to be an upgrade.","PROS-Perfectly Balanced Sound Signature (Subjectively better than XM4)-Hands down one of the best Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) Technology-Lightweight and Comfortable (for X amount of hours)-Excellent Battery LifeCONS-Build Quality feels Cheap and Fragile-Earpads can Deform, get Hot (sweaty), and become Uncomfortable-Flimsy Case-PriceyOh wow!","Sony got the sound signature right this time.","The previous model, Sony WH-1000XM4, has a V-Shaped sound signature (recessed mids with focus on the highs and lows) that is catered towards the general public but the lack of mids just doesn't sound right to my ears.","The latest iteration, Sony WH-1000XM5, has a perfectly tuned sound signature that is balanced throughout the range.","The earpads can also deform which is not ideal as it may affect the sound signature (due to loss of proper seal) and comfort.","The sound quality is just excellent and the noise cancelling is top notch.","I really do enjoy this headphone and am satisfied with its sound performance.","There is storage space for the USB-C Cable to charge them.As far as sound quality, I think these sound a bit better than the previous generation.","Everything is a bit more detailed and generally \"tighter\" sounding on these.","Everything was bright and crisp and voice sounded very clear.","I've been very impressed with the audio quality so far.Noise Cancellation is good, but considering the use the same sensor as the last generation (XM4's had a single processor for this, XM5's have 2 of that same sensor), I was expecting a lot more sound to be canceled out.","There is some minor discomfort with the head band as some have noted but I found I got used to it quick and it doesn’t really bother me.Both headphones sound excellent for movies, tv shows and YouTube and I doubt I could tell them apart in their basic settings.","The AirPods make it sound like the voices and effects are coming from the screen and surrounding you.","In comparison the sound from the Sonys are localizable from the drivers.","The voices come direct to your ears from the drivers which doesn’t sound as good and can take me out of whatever I’m watching.","Sound wise I prefer the AirPods bc of the spatial audio.","Without a good ANC, I will not be able to hear the sound clearly unless I turn up the volume all the way up.","I am not sure who wins here.Sound Quality:Some instruments, especially Guitar, sounded natural and amazing on Momentum 4.","But not every instrument sounded great.","Now some instruments like Drum sounded better on Sony XM5.","I will deduct one point for Sony XM5 here.Sound Stage :This was my main deciding factor.","When listening to music overall, Sony XM5s sounded lively and immersive.","Momentums on the other hand sounded flat and boring.","For me Sony XM5 won here.Equalizer & App:I liked Sony App and Equalizer much better.Sound Quality on Higher Volume:Increasing the volume on Momentum 4, flatten the sound.","On Sony XM5, the sound quality remained the same on any volume.Final Verdict:I decided to keep Sony XM5 and returned Sennheiser Momentum 4.","I also compared with the Bose Quiet Comfort 35, and 700 headphones, and Apple's AirPods Max.I sampled many types of music from CDs directly through a high-quality Sony Blu-ray disc player with a wire, then repeated with Bluetooth 5.0 using iTunes with ALAC Lossless without external amplification, and Amazon Music on the highest quality settings.Sony's DSEE Extreme is impressive at upscaling compressed digital files and seems to make even old MP3s sound better.","Perhaps it is just my ear, but the brilliance of the sound playing classical, jazz, and classic rock is slightly below my expectations.","I understand that these are not audiophile headphones, but at the $399 price point, they should have a \"music\" or \"movie\" capability or setting to reveal the vividness and \"color\" of the original recording.If you read the technical specifications, it appears that Sony is aiming toward a reference or studio quality; the pure flat sound without any \"juicing.\"","Sometimes, the extra sound stage is desirable, though often it allows the listener to hear the mixing choices made in the recording studio, even the flaws.","For music, where the quality of sound really is the point of the experience, I will use other headphones, including the WH-1000XM4 and the excellent WF-1000XM4 \"True Wireless\" in-ear buds.These are purely my opinions.","Sound quality is great.","I tried the Bose from a less expensive to the most expensive and to be honest The Sony WH-1000XM series, from XM2 through the latest XM5's are the hands down absolute best from noise cancelling, sound quality and comfort.","I sometimes even wear them to sleep, though I wouldn't recommend that.Noise cancellation and sound quality: these definitely seem to be a notable improvement in noise cancellation over my previous XM3s, and with similar NC but better sound quality, compared to the XM4.","You have more options than with previous models to customise your sounds and buttons -- one feature that's easy to miss: if you keep accidentally getting into speak-to-chat mode, you can turn it off easily by pressing on the right headphone cup with two fingers and holding until you hear it disengage (much easier than turning it off in the app every time).","Top notch sound quality, companion app is actually useful, battery life for days and comfortable enough that you can actually wear them for hours on end.","But the sound itself is first-rate, with a well-rounded and enveloping sound that's great for music of all kinds, and movies too.","You certainly can't fault them on sound, noise cancellation, or convenience.","The sound quality is great, but every so often it disconnects from my computer.","Yes they sound great.","The “I turned on” and “I turned off” sounds are distinct but I could not write down how to tell them apart (even if I knew) from the similar pleasant chimes for “ANC on/off” or “Bluetooth paired / disconnected”.","Best sounding headphones I’ve ever used with the best noise cancellation.","I also tried the Bose 700’s, which sound great but the noise cancellation has a weird vacuum effect…the XM5s don’t have that.","If you are an audiophile and really appreciate how your music sounds all the time these are changing the games.","Even the mdr-v6, or the newer version 7506, are great options with 40mm drivers.The sound on these BT headphones is good, and the battery technology is great.","Hence, Sony making a $400 30mm headphone.Get a decent new or used Home Theater amp, and some good corded headphones, and hear real sound.","Even FM radio will sound dynamic.","$400 buys you some awesome old school super sound.","Sound quality, noise cancellation, and comfort are all amazing.","The sound quality is where this shines.","For meetings and phone calls, he has clear and crisp sound, no background noise, and has no muffling or crackling sounds.","He can block out sound or just minimize the volume.","They sound better, they mute better, they last longer, and you can wear them for hours without discomfort.","The sound quality is SUPERB.","These are light weight - which is something I will admit they have an edge over the AirPods Max on (those are on the heavy side)I tested these with a variety of music to check tones, bass, and overall sound quality.","Sound quality is top notch as always.","Good sound quality.","Good :Active noise cancellation is fantastic!Fast charging is good, bluetooth connectivity is fine!The call quality is amazing.The app shows the SPL levels and it's effects on hearing which is awesome!Bad :360Reality Audio is a gimmick, should've had AptX HD, AptX Adoptive along with LDAC because with LDAC you cannot connect two devices at once.The outer plastic cladding near the foam pads push the frames and makes it a bit uncomfortable (those with specs are better off with XM4).Ugly:The sound quality is good when you don't EQ , but if you use their own apps EQ it's good only upto 70% once you increase the volume beyond it starts to distort and once you turn it all the way up the EQ just flatens and sounds like hot garbage.I don't hear beyond 60-70% volume but even if i want the volume to go to max the SPL doesn't go beyond 99db with any codec I've tried LDAC, AAC, SBC with their upscaler DSEE Extreme no change whatsoever.Also the change in volume beyond 70-75% is really not much and infact the headphones only start to distort!","Absolutely dulls the sounds down and I actually fell asleep with how quiet my surroundings were.","The sound quality is absolutely horrible compared to other headphones I've listened to.","The volume also doesn't get high enough in my opinion; also the higher you turn the volume the less \"full\" sounding the music is if listening to songs, especially if you have custom settings on the equalizer (makes it sound cheap).","Seriously Sony who thought of the no folding design?While they're very light and comfy, have great noise cancelling for certain frequencies, contain amazing call quality, have 30-40 hrs of battery and the touch sensors on the right ear cup are SUPER fun and easy to use, I would not buy these if you're also expecting great sound.","The surround sound is a gimmicky feature.","Sony should partner with at least a few major movie/song streaming websites to support surround sound experience.","The sound quality out of the box is not good for what you pay.","In teams call on windows, it makes a lot of hissing sound even when everyone is on mute.8.","The swivel on two earcups have a plastic feel and do make creeky sounds often.10.","Honestly, if you try xm4 or xm3, they will provide comparable experience and better experience in sound.","Sound quality is certainly different, but I wouldn’t go as far as to say it’s better.","Sound quality is great but physically poor build, it broke after 6 months of owning it, Sony doesn’t cover physical damage on warranty so be you’ll have to baby these the whole time you own them.","I like the sound quality and noise cancellation.","!I am amazed and have recommend them to multiple people.They are quite pricey but honestly with this sound quality and this ability to be able to blockout almost all noise is incredible a whole new experience these are worth it if you have the money!","The sound quality is very refined.","I don't hear any weird noise sounds when moving or air puffiness in my ear.","This is my favorite one by far.I travel a lot and mostly use these when travelling, for conference calls on the fly, music, tv shows, noise reduction on the plane and so on and it’s simply perfect in all these aspects:- Sound quality is very impressive- Noise cancelling is top of the field- Voice clarity for the microphone on my calls is perfect for my coworkers- Syncing is a breeze- Controls are easy to get a handle onVery very satisfied with this acquisition.","The surround sound is amazing and it's very clear without having to put the volume too high.All electronics by \"Sony\" never seem to disappoint.","PROS:Fantastic ANC (utilizes 8 microphones)Paired much easier and quicker than any other BT headphones I’ve triedLouder volume than any other BT headphones I’ve triedOutstanding sound qualityGreat control and features within the AppVery responsive and intuitive touch controls - I raised the volume by correctly guessing to swipe up on the right ear cup.Love the case with a magnetic closure inside that stores charge cable etc.Very happy that they have included the option to use as wired headphonesAmazing battery life (up to 30 hours) with quick charge options (3 minute charge with a USB-PD compatible charger gives 3 hours of use)Can be paired with 2 bluetooth devices at the same timeGood adjustments can be made for a comfortable fitVery lightweight for their sizeCONS:My ears were sweating a bit after prolonged use…could be more comfortable","The mic quality has improved significantly, making voices sound more realistic, and the sound quality sees a reduction in the bass and increase in the treble to make music sound more neutral.","Furthermore, with cheap wired and wireless IEMs providing better sound at lower prices than ever before, wireless noise-cancelling over-ears have become stagnant (in terms of technology, competition, and price) that the value of such a product is questionable.","What do I talk about the insulation for the annoying sound in the background, or the sound you hear like magic?","This headset is really great worth buying because the music comes out like magic Isolation is very cool and comfortable Do not be alarmed  The thing that amazed me is the battery, the sound and the insulation well.","When you turn on the loud sound, you feel like you are in front of a singer or singer.","Great sound quality and noise cancellation.","After several hours my ears are not hot but the pressure is a bit higher than I would have preferred to set.Sound: sounds quality is excellent and follows Sony's typical tuning, great mid ranges and softer on the bass, clarity is second to none.","( despite an equalizer that is present)ANC: Sony's ANC is quite powerful and I am impressed with the amount of sound if blocks out.","Music sounds great.","I don't have somewhere to hang them at work, or in my locker, and the case is one more thing to have to carry and open for security.I know it sounds minor, but after 3 months, it added up, and I went back to my old pair.","PROS:- new design is lightweight and comfortable- headband is comfortable- touch controls are great and intuitive- auto speak works great- App allows fine tuning and settings- case is solid and slim- ANC is superb- sound is top notch!CONS:- matte finish will grab your fingerprintsI have sampled several of Sony's previous generations of the 1000XM series and though they were great in both sound and ANC performance, I wasn't won over by the fit and feel of the past generations.","My only gripe is that the cups have a matte finish which is a fingerprint magnet if you aren’t careful.Sound:  Sony headphones have always had a great soundscape.","Just go into the app and adjust the sound as needed.","I have been able to crank up the volume on several genres of music and the sound never distorts or gets muffled in high output.","I prefer a more balanced sound and with closed earcups you’ll appreciate less bass over time.ANC: this is where things get exciting!","Summary:Very good noise cancellingTop notch sound performanceExcellent Bluetooth connectivityMore expensive than similar competitors, and even Sony’s previous generation XM4Does not fold into a compact shapeThe recently released Sony WH-1000XM5 (from now on I’ll just refer to them as the “XM5”) is the latest set of noise cancelling wireless headphones from Sony, building on the success of the previous model, the XM4.","Although the earcup padding seals out external sound fairly well, the headphones let you hear your own voice clearly by feeding it through the headphones.The noise cancelling works best on low frequency sounds, as is common with most NC headphones.","Traffic sounds, aircraft sounds and machinery were filtered out well.","If you don’t put the headphones back on after a few minutes, the headphones will shut off.Another feature is useful when you want to briefly hear ambient sounds, such as a PA announcement or similar.","Cupping your hand over the right earcup will pause playback and feed in ambient sound.","It also monitors your listening habits and can warn you to limit your volume to prevent hearing loss.Now to the most important aspect of these headphones – sound quality.","These are by far the best sounding wireless headphones I have ever heard, and they match up well to premium wired headphones.","Simply amazing!These headphones sounded great with conventional sources such as Spotify or 320kbps mp3s.","The demo on their web site sounded absolutely mesmerizing.","Sound is great, features and noise cancellation above mu expectations","The headphones are perfect, with phenomenal noise cancellation, great sound quality and very comfortable.","No need to comment on sound quality, Sonys are always top tier.","The volume on these things are super low a cheap sound quality compared to beats..","Amazing sound quality, great bass (make sure you get the headphones app).","These do not sound any better than any other &50-$100 headphones.","Sound quality - bass heavy out of the box, but the equalizer in the app can bring the sound profile back to neutral quite easily.","Sound quality is great and the headphones are light and comfortable for long listening sessions.","I hadn't realized how much sound my refrigerator made until I got this.I have WF-1000XM3(the older ear buds) which supposedly have great noise cancelling, and having used them I can confirm they do that part well enough.","The sound quality is clear.","Expect high bass because this is closed back, but again you can't have good sound isolation otherwise.","Noise cancellation is better than any I’ve tried and I work with high velocity dryers that are 108 DB and they just sound like wind in the distance.","The sound is perfection","The sound quality is FANTASTIC!","I tried using it to stream once instead of my gaming headset for my pc but it wasn't as capable with the microphone and getting where the sound was coming from.","Love these - amazing noise cancelling features, the sound quality is great and they're perfect for my very loud work environment.","If I have to give full mark, I will give it for noise cancellation(10/10) ,sound quality is also good as well as Bluetooth connectivity.","Have the 1000MX4 also, though with several tech support calls over the year about digital sounds (son had a pair that was not making the sounds streaming from the same device)I finally gave up and just bought the next generation.","Wasted over $450 on the MX4, thought I would just get a replacement set mailed to me after a number times reporting that they just were not working as intended.MX4 vs MX5Cons:-Don't fold up as nicely as the MX4 do-Don't have the same audio alerts (power on/off) that I found useful on the MX4-Not quite as comfortable as the MX4Pros:-Haven't heard the digital sounds using the same devices-Have a slightly nicer appearance compared to MX4","Very effective, perfect noise cancellation, great sound quality and battery lasts forever.","I'm sure you have seen raving reviews of the product all over the internet, I too was convinced this might just be the best product for me, and so, I ordered these headphones without having an in-store sound test, something which I never do as a rule.","Should've stuck to my rule, these sound worse than my KZ ZSN Pro Xs, and those are an entry level iems!","Sound was muddy which as a treble lover completely disgusted me (seriously, you can listen to the extremely minute vibrations of the guitar strums in la vie róse with good treble but all that detail is just lost on these) but usually in such cases the bass compensates, but even in that regard this product is underwhelming, the heart thumping bass just isn't there, you expect an impact on the drop and get a muzzled thwomp instead, which is sooo frustrating, just leaves you unsatisfied at what should be the climax of the composition.I have tried updating the drivers, retuning using wavelet, used my trusty IFI ZEN and fiddled with the bass bost for hours on end and yet am completely puzzled as to how so many people rate these so high.","I use these headphones both on Bluetooth to my phone and wired at my desk plugged into an analog music source.I use the ANC in all use cases, and it's really good for mitigating distractions.I have avoided the smartphone app and higher-level configurations as for now I just need headphones to be headphones.Wired Analog; ANC is optional when wired, and a full charge lasts for 20-24 hours of constant play.Wired USB; works well, and of course charges at the same timeBlueTooth; Of course not as rich as an analog source, but still sounds great, and when using as a 2-way headset I'm quite impressed at the sound quality and noise-rejection on both ends.Callers on the other end of a BT call report very solid sound quality on my voice.Runtime per charge is reduced somewhat while on BT, I'd guess something like 10-12 hoursComfort;Spring compression is about right to balance between comfort and sealing.It would be nice if the pad stuffing was a bit more resilient, as on the head the pads compress until my ears are in contact with the speaker grid and that can get uncomfortable after an hour or so.CONS;The ANC does not time out when there's no signal, which has left me several times with a dead battery when I've been interrupted, taken them off and forgotten to power down the headphones.One other \"feature\" that i don't really care for is that speaking aloud while ANC is on cancels the ANC and mutes the source until you manually flip it back on again.","You may only hear very high pitched noises like horns or high revving motorcycles if they're close by.Sound quality is good too.","The VA will guide you on the further steps)- The Noise Cancelling (Bummer), The sound (Play the 360 Spatial Audio video on YT)- Volume at 60% should be enough for most people to enjoy the music.- Extremely comfortable to wear for long durations and these charge really fast.- The Bluetooth range is good enough to roam around a duplex without worrying about fades.- The app gives enough customizability freedom.","Powerful bass and very rich sound.","Superior sound quality, you can customize your EQ, and the ANC is amazing.","Sound better than my Bose and the noise cancelling is great.","The sound quality is amazing.","You can adjust and set different sound profiles for whatever you are listening to.The headphones are very comfortable, and I usually hate wearing headphones.","You can also set ANC to ambient sounds and ask it to emphasize voices, so you can hear people but not noise.","I wish they were on the left.The headphones do work out of the box without the app, but app lets you adjust the settings and get the most of them.I love the headphones, they sound so good","But it’s sooooooooo annoying.XM2 was far better in noise cancellation.And the sound quality?","XM2 had a clearer sound.","And I can totally hear the sound getting distorted on higher peaks.","Fortunately (or unfortunately for my pocket…) I own way too many headphones and can speak from experience using them everyday.- These can’t fold into a compact, easy-to-store size like it’s gen 4 predecessor or QC45.- Sound is muffled and far less clear than AirPod Max.- Unlike QC45, all controls are touch-based so get triggered even if you gently brush your head against curtains for example.I’m debating returning these honestly","They sound bad, feel worse than Bose headphones, and this pair had obviously already been bought by someone and returned, the package was not new and they had been paired to another phone already","They are too expensive simply because their sound quality is .. so so.","They have this extra 360 reality audio feature that they showcase briefly during setup... and that stuff sounded really good.","The sound quality just is a big disappointment.","Only for the sound quality.","Honestly, I have a pair of ankers that I think are as good sound quality, and they were a lot cheaper.","Sound wise they sound flat out fantastic in every genre of music.","Highs and vocals come though clean and clear and at max volume there is zero distortion or sound quality issues and the range is pretty incredible.","I'm no sound expert but one of the biggest factors that I've found in how to really get the best represented sound quality is to have a decent equalizer supported app or controllability and on that score Sony delivers.","In their app it is easy to navigate and the app has a ton of options to tweak and fine tune sound quality and performance.","Very comfy, the sound is incredible, and noise cancelation is from another world.","Sony is listening, the XM5 now has a more balance sound, more flat on the EQ.","The sound stage is more wider than XM4, the mids and highs are now more pronounce but not bright.","Noise cancelling is better than the XM$ at eliminating sound I used to get on the XM4 You'll get the same battery life as the XM4 also.","The sound quality is amazing and I can't wait to use these on my next flight.","Still love the sound.","Wide variety of sounds that become new with every upgrade.","The sound quality is great as always.","Sound is not noticeably better than a regular built in computer speaker.","They sound amazing, they look amazing, the ANC is amazing...ect...Just don't fit me well.","The sound is nice and the sound cancelling is decent.","Sound quality is good.","I like the sound quality of the xb950's but the noise canceling is so good it makes up for the lower sound output","Honestly I am not sure, the calls sound like I amI’m a tin can.","Lacking in sound too","The sound is great and noise canceling is a plus.","These headphones are amazing and sound so awesome.","I also tested them against a white noise machine that was 50 feet away, and they failed to block out this steady sound, even with music playing at a comfortable volume.End of Nov 2022, and end of the headphonesI contacted Sony through chat, and they had me reset them.","The headphones continued to turn on/off the music, and turn on/off the level of sound control.","I Love Sony products this would have been my 3rd pair of wireless from Sony..had to return them …Kick drum sounded synthetic poor bass response and this was after hours of adjusting EQ ..I think the driver is just to small 30MM…it’s a drag writing a poor review and I don’t like returning stuff","The headphones are simply amazing from sound, comfort and amazing ANC.","The sound is much improved from the XM4 but is still not where I would like it to be.","Using these in wired mode makes them sound horrible so that’s not a feature worth mentioning.","Noice cancelation, sound quality, weight, comfort, you name it the mark V comes out on top.","If you like squeeze plastic bag sound, this headset is your perfect choice!","muddy in lows and decent but not great soundstage.","These try hard and the noise cancellation is great, but the 360 sound is weak and just off..I got them for work, but the mics and connection did not do well with the limited use I did.Not bumming!The warning says no sweating lol, no problem these will fall of your head well before a sweat is broken, annoying.","First let’s start of by saying I’m seeing so many positive reviews by people who never owned the xm4 or previous models they sound like promo reviews by SONY if you ask me, so you can understand the frustration by people who have owned previous models, first let’s start with noise cancellation which is awful on the xm5 no manual adjustments to the noise cancellation, and the auto noise cancellation optimization is a zonk on this generation Sony you took something so simple and nice and just messed it up, taking phone calls with these headphones were great and battery life is always awesome with the XM LINEUP,  now let’s start with the clamping force on this one I find myself having to lift the headphones off of my head because the feeling is so tight never had an issue with the XM4, the build quality on this one feels okay and the touch controls are much faster and responsive on this generation, the ability to not fold on this generation is a zonk to me as well but it looks like Sony is going in this direction so this would have some getting used to as they are following the other competitors with their designs as well, sound quality is great not excellent as everyone has their own methods and ideas as to what good sounding headphones are, until the noise cancellation is fixed, clamping force and more comfortable pads I don’t see the reason to try to like these headphones because they are the newest thing out, these manufacturers are putting out junk and not ready products at the cost of my wallet","The only good thing is the noise cancelation other than that the sound quality is mediocre.","The sound is clear and the noise cancellation is on top.","No one ever claimed they sounded good, but the ANC was unparalleled.","With the Sony WH-1000XM5 you get reasonably crisp audio, good sound stage, and excellent ANC.","The phone call quality is much better and I personally think the sound is better but not by much.","The sound is amazing.","I've been using XM3 for about 4 years now.I skipped XM4 as I heard it's not much better than XM3.As for XM5, as I heard it's got phenomenal features, so I wanted to give it a try.For sound quality, it is definitely alot better than XM3-Its directional sound is noticeably better than that of XM3,And music/movies/games just sound so much better.Some of the really cool feature it's got are speak to chat and multiple connection features.Speak to chat allows me to talk to someone freely without taking off the headphones.Multiple connection feature allows me to switch from my PC to my phone instantly when I get a call, or play a video on my phone.As for noise cancelling, XM3 seems to have better ANC.I thought I was able to hear more noises when wearing XM5, but it didn't seem that far off.My biggest disappointment was its comfort.Due to playing video games on a daily basis for long time, I sometimes wear the headphones for 8~12 hours.","sound, noise control are awesome when doing homework.","the sound quality isn’t mindblowing at first but tweaking the equalizer in the app should fix this.i’ve never owned a pair of noise canceling headphones before, but to me the noise canceling is very solid.","They sound AMAZING (Sony's rich and full sound is unmatched).They are SUPER lightweightThe noise cancelling is BETTER than the Apple Airpods max headphonesVery nice travel caseThe only reason I returned them is even on their smallest adjustable setting they were too big for my normal sized head.","There is a bug that if you move them the wrong way and unable to figure out the exact movement that you loose sound and require a full on and off the return to normal function","Sometimes i am hearing an odd sound on the right side of the headphones.","My friend had the QC 35 II and the sound was kinda lifeless tbh.","The sound quality on these are amazing and you can adjust what you want with the EQ.","These are just fine as mentioned before the sound quality is just great to me(I'm not an audiophile).Build quality 10/10Sound quality 10/10.","(Only thing I heard that sounded bad from a different person was wired but I don't plan on using these wired.","When crossing a street, one can either push a button for ambient sound or simply cup a hand over the right ear to temporarily activate ambient sound.The swipe controls (volume increase / decrease and forward / back for tracks) make this pair of headphones easier to operate than any other pair of headphones I have.","No need to look away to handle my music or podcasts, which is quite helpful.While on the train, passengers' sounds fade away, allowing me to focus on whatever I'm listening to or watching.","Pricey but incredible sound, great noise cancellation and comfortable to wear.Only drawback is they don’t fold down like the previous Sony headphone models.","Initially I did not like how they sounded so thankfully the app has an EQ that you can use to change the sound.","I have never spent more than $120 on earphones/headphones, but I wanted to know what \"expensive\" headphones would sound like.","This was a tremendous change and I am now satisfied with the volume.The bass on these headphones are great, but I like deeper bass, to where it should sound muddled, so these did not meet my expectations.","The \"see through\" mode (hear through) amplifies the sounds around you so you can hear them while you listen to music, but if your music volume is above 40%, you still won't hear anything from the outside, unless it's very loud.The headphones (with the app) come with a cool feature where they stop playback and enable the \"hear-through\" mode so that you can talk to people without having to either take off the headphones or stop your music.","I've had them for eight months or so now and wish i had gone with something else.Pros: Good sound, comfortable when wearing.Cons: Auto-shut off, difficult to maneuver for one-ear listening.I've found that maybe I'm weird, but I often like to free an ear to listen to the room rather than the headphones.","This sounds like a feature but it acts like a bug.","First time buyer for anything involving SonyI’m not disappointed at all, if your on the fence about these please get this head set the Bluetooth is instant on any device, if you want more bass learn how to use the EQ settings and they can give you some really nice sounds, the adaptive sound feature is great, anytime I go into a new room it’s analyzing it and adjusting properlyBottom line get this headset","But the sound quality and noise cancellation is perfect for my school trips so I’ll be keeping them.","Very Musical, balanced sound.","The volume could be one setting louder, the noise cancelation 15 % better, but the sound quality and comfort makes these a great fit.","There are a number of recommended Apps for these to enhance the sound experience, but these all have $$ subscriptions and in App purchases.","The sound is crisp and you can suit it to fit your personal listening preferences.","With its industry leading noise cancelation system, you can enjoy high quality sound from  Bluetooth or enjoy the headphone's full frequency range of an astounding, 4 hz to 40k hz,  with its 3.5mm, wired connection option, while still being able to experience the sounds of the world around you.Either way, you get a wide sound pallet, from deep punchy base to crisp highs anda well defined midrange.The available software found on the Sony website, allows you to fully customize the way sound is reproduced by the large 30mm, soft edged drivers, giving you full control over how you enjoy, music, movies, dialog and much more.In my opinion, these headphones compare favorably against other more expensive premium name brand, noise canceling headphones available today.","There are probably cheaper headphones that have better sound quality from other less mainstream brands but the anc is the main selling point","Sound quality rivals Bose which should be expected for the price.","The sound quality was good.","Not to mention that, as a musician, the Bose QC series feature a flat(ter) sound profile which I prefer more.","The sound quality, features, comfort, and price (well, for the under $500 price point) are unmatched to anything that I’ve ever experienced.Plenty of bass, treble, and midrange for anything that I listen to, with nice functional features like when my wife wants to have a quick conversation (I just hold my hand over the right side of the ear pad and the volume turns low) or if I want to say something without taking the headphones off, it’ll just pause whatever is playing, are nice little features.I’m sure that there are other over the ear headphones out there that are superior, but nothing that I’ve found at this price point.","Bought these for work and I am distracted 99% less of the time with co-worker talk.I tried these out once for home(gaming PC use) and the sound was garbage.","Sound quality is a little better, the sliders that commonly broke on the previous models are a different style now so I think they will last much longer.","These feel great and look great, my only (minor) complaint so far is they no longer tell you \"power off\" when you turn them off and they no longer tell you \"noise canceling\" or \"ambient sound\" when you switch between modes, they just have a series of beeps you have to memorize.","These are the best headphones on the market the  noise cancelling and sound is amazing.","Sound quality is good but I do wish they went louder because I like my music LOUD.","The sound quality was less than I had expected.I ended up buying Sennheiser Momentum 4's.","They were less expensive and had better overall sound than the Sony WH1000XM-5s.","To test the noise cancellation I turned the sound on about 1/3 volume and my dad spoke to me and I could not hear him.","I see that LDAC noticeably improves the sound quality (atleast to my ears) and overall I am happy with the performance.I own bang and Olufsen H9i but I needed something for taking calls, listening music and travel.","Though bang and Olufsen checks sound part but it is not portable and gets heavy on after 30 mins of wearing.","This headphone NC and sound is at par with the Bose 700 but consider that the  700s was release in 2019, Sony still some ways to go and definitely not worth the asking price.","Very comfortable, great sound, love them.","I only notice because I have XM5 as smallest setting possible and it fits me, where as with XM3/XM4 I had them a few notches bigger.Sound from XM5 is not noticabely better as far as I can tell.Its honestly hard for me to think of anything XM5 do better than XM4.","Besides some high frequency sounds, the headphone was able to cancel out over 95% the noises.","The remaining 5% are all higher frequency sounds but those can be ignored very easily.Now I’m not an audiophile so I can’t really comment on how it sounds, but it sounds good enough for me.","My son and I have auditory processing disorders, so the noise gets unbearable.We use these, even without sound it has saved us alot of pain, it's a relief to put them on,and be able to sit in a quiet head.","Sound quality was dog s***.","Pardon my French, but it sounded so so bad.","I thought by buying 400 USD headphones I would be blown away.Noise cancelling is nice, but, audio is as good as my 40 and 80 USD headphones from SoundCore and TaoTronics.Noise cancelling might be a little better, but definitely not worth spending 5-10 times what I had with my other headphones.I travel a lot so I thought, I'll pay a premium price to ensure I minimize any outside noise when on a plane or a bus, but it has come with a lot of problems.It pairs with my Win 10 computer, but, audio dissapears every now and then and I have to connect and disconnect.Would definitely return the product if I could, I'm overseas and these are headphones are trouble makers.","The XM5’s (even with adaptive sound control off), seems to toggle the noise cancelation up and down in different environments instead of just keeping the noise cancellation at high.","Absolutely amazing sound.","Sound is nice I like how the app lets you adjust the sound with preset mods and your own customizable mod.","The mics too are nice they sound good in videos, audio messages, and on phone calls.","Much lighter then Apple, and just as good in sound.","The second thing is that if you use them with speed outside (running, really windy out, or a bus/car window is open) then the wind will fill up the noise cancelling sensors and cause some pretty loud and odd sounds.","entirely disappointed in overall sound quality and the features stop at noise cancellation.","Otherwise they have great sound quality, comfort and noise cancelation.","But they fixed that with these.They also sound better than the XM4's.","Both still deliver a pretty smooth, warm sound signature that is not fatiguing for long listening sessions.Also the color is better.","I've tried to love them for a year and a half, but I can't because they have a sound as cold as the metal they are made from.","And Apple being Apple, they did not give you an app to EQ the sound to your liking like Sony does.","You can use some accessibility features to slightly change the sound but this introduces white noise and is just a poor excuse for EQ.","I have always upgraded my cars speakers and added subwoofers, had a sound bar and sub at home etc.","I like a full range, crisp clear sound that works for all types of music.","These headphones are the BEST SOUND I have ever heard out of a speaker.","If you love music and want life changing sound I highly recommend these.","They are super comfortable with or without glasses, sound amazing and battery life is superb.","The noise cancellation is excellent and the sound quality especially when u listen to music it is totally worth buying.","I travel for work, take a lot of planes and talk on the phone and work in industrial environment where noise level goes to over 95db... After losing two sets of earbuds in airport (200$) decided I am not good with small items (dropped box once on an airplane, had to wait for entire plane to leave to look for one of the buds lol it rolled 5 seats ahead, laughed at the time, luckily overlay was 4 hours.After losing 200$ worth of earbuds I've decided it was enough and started researching Bluetooth over ear headphones, from my experience Sony made very good headphones (first pair i bought 20 years ago) in fact i think Sony makes the best sounding portable speakers and headphones, but it is my own opinion.I got these headphones and kept them in package to do more research online and watch more reviews and what I've found that these headphone made sense.","Sound quality is fantastic as well, i enjoy quality sound, own a pair of Beyerdynamic 770dt 80ohm and these Sonies  are just as enjoyable to listen, maybe lag behind the Beyers with quality of sounds, but still sound incredible and I don't have to carry a portable amp to listen to them lolbattery life is another feature that I'm amazed with, listened all day and didn't discharge, i cant say i listened for 30 hours without charge yet, simply because i don't want to run out of battery while I'm listening to an audiobook in an industrial facility, but 10 hours at a time they lasted no problem.","My previous Bose soundsport's were better at such decisions.Sound quality (music): I can say there's a small degradation in sound quality since XM1.","While the XM1 had great sound across most frequencies, these (XM5s) are more bass heavy and light on mids and trebles.","I haven't played with the EQ enough yet so maybe this is fixable.Sound quality (calls): Much improved microphones as compared to XM1s.","It is fine, in every aspect, the sound quality and battery life is just a step ahead from its previously generation.The fit and the comfort though, is just bad for me personally, I struggle to wear this continuously for more than an hour, that’s where it’s really disappointing.","Primary job of this headphone is to sound good.","But it has a very Average sound for the price.","The sound quality is no doubt amazing and I heardparts of songs I had never heard before but I could not take any calls while working and had to go through the whole process of either disconnecting Bluetooth or holding the phone Infront of my face.","Now I can hear enough ambient sound to be aware of what's going on around me without it intruding on what I'm listening to.","It would be better if the blue light stayed lit when on.Sound quality is very good IMO, though I have limited experience with high end headphones.","The quality of sound is very good.","Also, one of its best features is that it detects your movement and adjusts your setting accordingly, which we can choose from ambient sound, noise cancelling.","The sound is pretty epic in comparison to the 3s, the low end is more detailed and defined this time around.The mids and highs are present and not at all muddy.The call quality with the extra mics is amazing, it also cancels the background noise very well.Also, the new design is great, no creaking with this design.","If you're coming from XM3s or earlier, or you are in the market for great-sounding headphones these work amazingly well.","Superb surround and crisp sound.","Need to check few more sound quality","When you use it with your phone it sounds tinny and echos trying to switch back to the TV I have to re pair it every time I would return it if it wasn’t so difficult to return product on line","Great noise cancellation, sound and comfort, better than XM4.","To my surprise they sounded worse.","Sounds blurry at first.","I was debating between the xm4 and the xm5 but I decided to get these ones because I heard these have a better sound quality.","In a nutshell, the sound of these cans isn't working for me.","Sound pressure/ dB warning is amazing for protecting your ears3.","Overall sound quality is pretty good, but super similar to these other two","I've tried many headphones over the years, had an older model which I still love but I decided to try these.I highly recommend these to anyone, don't let the price put you off, you get your money's worth with the quality,  sound and anc.Nice work on eco packaging too Sony.Beautiful case to keep them in too.So happy with this investment!","It creates a muddy sound.","Absolutely amazing sound quality.","It is like the headphones went into a power-save mode or something, but randomly, since the period was not always the same, don't get me wrong, I love the sound, and the Noice Canceling is just the best.","This review was written on May 31, 2022PROS:The sound quality and battery life are absolutely amazing.","To put into perspective what is happening kinda, i put on a constant sound at 60-140hz and try my AirPods, I hear nothing.","I repeated this test multiple times along with a real world test with wind and people talking and the xm5’s, even after giving them time to adjust their adaptive ANC, were performing significantly worse than the same product 2 generations old, and my AirPods maxes.Conclusion: The headphones are really good, sound quality is unmatched by any other Bluetooth headset, and in general, the most optimal combination of everything you could ask for in a daily use headphone.","Sound is a little better and features like N/C are improved.","Sound quality 👌 👏 🙌 👍Noice canceling greatTouch control interactiveCall quality I shocked 😲World best noice canceling and call 📞 quality and sound quality all in one headphonesOverall no waste of moneyJust buy u r music 🎶 lover","When on VCs, it has a strange tinny sound, like I'm talking across a distance through a metallic instrument...Would I buy this again: NoWhy am I not returning it?","I expected lot wider sound stage from XM5.3.","But Not the Best in terms Sound Quality, Sound Stage I would say.","I use it at work to pair my cellphone for music and my work phone for calls.Microphone is crystal clearHeadphones app is good to adjust settings and sound options.Beautiful case that comes with it where you can store the headphones and there's a little place to put the wires.Cons:Easy to leave grease stain on it because of the mat color (for the black ones).Charging USB cord is wayyyy too short (like 4 inches).They don't fold ( I personally don't mind).","Sound quality is great and the noise cancelling is some of the best I’ve tried.","While anxiously awaiting delivery, I watched every YouTube unboxing and review and was super excited for the supposed best in class ANC and sound.Unfortunately, my experience did not match all of the youtubers.","Finally, the ear cups are so large — almost comedically large — that these really don’t look so great on your head.That being said, the sound quality was very nice.","All genres of music sounded great.The real disappointing thing for me was the ANC.","The poor fit offers very little PASSIVE noise cancelation, which is really a key component of keeping the sound out.","Amazing fit, premium build quality, great ANC, and surprisingly fun sound.","Sure they lack some of the cool extra features of the XM5s like speak to chat, auto pause when removing the cans etc…but who cares if they can’t keep the sound out (for me at least).So in conclusion, if you don’t have a huge head and want a more premium feeling pair of headphones that just do what they’re supposed to do very well, I’d recommend the 700s.","My understanding is that ANC headphones are supposed to cancel continuous sounds and these things are continuous sounds imo.","Sound quality was good, but not game changing (coming from AKG Y500).Next, when I would remove headphones from my head (or ears) and put them back, everything other than the power button would stop working.","But based on the aforementioned experience, I returned.I was able to find a great deal on SoundCore ANC headphones which are probably like 95% as good as these headphones in terms of both ANC as well as sound quality (after fiddling with equalizer) under $100 which is way more value for money.","Probably my only complaint with the SoundCore headphones is the mic quality which causes trouble during calls in noisy environment (which these Sony headphones were the boss at).TLDR: Not worth the price.","Otherwise, go with SoundCore ANC headphones.","Had to switch to this model because XM3 is becoming very hard to findI don't understand the glowing reviewsIt's a step down on the WH-1000XM3 in possibly every way except battery life, which was already long enough to begin withThe padding is much less comfortableBass was apparently balanced and boosted by someone who's deaf to lower frequenciesSize adjustment is needlessly fashionable yet unpracticalMuch more sensible to internal sound from your mouth, or the jack cable touching anythingThe right earphone touchpad sensitivity is ridiculously high, to the point it activates on its own at randomBut worse than all this, while my XM3 models died from the right earphone basically frying out in noise cancelling mode, and what do you know, the XM5 already has right earphone issues barely 1 week after purchase, as opposed to 2 yearsRandom crackling, \"underwater\" audio, issues which can only be fixed by... slapping the earphoneNeedless to say it's not going to last long at this rateAt that price mark this is practically a bad joke and a scam","Great noise cancellation and great sound.","Amazing sound quality.","Casual listening…jazz, classical, rock…The best quality sound with noise cancelling.","For me the standout feature is it's battery life, It's been a week now and battery is still at 16 % without single charge, overall I guess it last between 23-26 hours with ANC.Sound quality is good when you use custom equalizer setting but It's not outstanding, may be I was expecting magic out of it.","The headphones sounds good, but they are uncomfortable to wear for long hours.","The sound quality of XM5 is amazing, it’s bass heavy.","It is my First Headphones from Sony.I bet you will never regret buying this.The crisp and clear sound with theatre like bass.It enhanced my experience of enjoying multimedia.","The latest firmware update fixes this — and makes this issue less frequent (almost nonexistent).I have always enjoyed the sound quality on SONY, but with XM5, you can definitely notice a change (if you're used to XM3, and XM4 sound signatures).","If you can easily to hear all noises near around then what does it mean.Second Comfortability,  Your head will start paining after 30 min from the top side.Last Sound Quality: This headphone not for music listers.Poor Application, Pricing is bit high and worthless.","Yes, it seems that at least Sony understands how to handle clamp pressure appropriately on that end.Here's where the problem lies - THE SOUND QUALITY!","I've seen a number of reviews that mention that these cans have great sound quality.","I've got a piece of advice for you - either go back in time and get the original MDR-1000X headphones or simply go with the XM4 cans (that pretty much sound exactly the same as the MDR-1000x but I digress).","The sound quality of those cans are leagues above the XM5.","I did a compare and contrast with the sound quality.","The 1000x & XM4's are far punchier and clearer sounding than the XM5's.I've seen some people mentioning that the bass is just right with the XM5's.","Here's the problem though - the XM5's sound very...fizzled out?","There's no punch to the sound, and the worst part is that even listening to people talk on YouTube videos or watching videos, and you'll begin to realize how bad the XM5's are in terms of sound.","People's voices just don't sound right.","You'll even hear sound effects don't even sound as pronounced as you'd hear them in any pair of other headphones or even through tv speakers.","Any music you listen to also sounds very flat and muddy.I really wanted to like the XM5's, truly I did.","They are comfy headphones in terms of clamp pressure after all, but considering the very disappointing sound quality combined with extremely cheap build quality, the XM5's have to be returned.Sony, if you're reading this, please take note!","We don't care about excuses anymore, please go back to the trademark sound of older models at the very least if you can't do anything about build quality.","The sound quality is also excellent.","Each time I have to go through a connection process usually several times - usually involving removing the headphones from the sound output device and starting to connect them again from scratch - before the headphones will connect again.","Great noise cancellation and sound(once you use the equalizer).","They are incredibly comfortable, have crystal clear sound, and solid battery life.","The sound quality is great - not only does the sound cancelling work incredibly well, but the audio quality is clear and bright.","Using the app was pretty easy and user-friendly for setting up 360 sound as well as for accessing the mixer.","The XM5 literally sound like those Panasonic earbuds you get at the 99 cent store.","There is zero instrument separation, it all sounds like a bunch of noise crammed together.","Even the XB900n sound better.","No matter how you go into Sound Settings or Devices you CANNOT “connect” to the paired Sony wh1000xm5 selecting the “handsfree” one which activates the mics.","Incredible sound quality across the entire spectrum of sound.","Had these about a week and in my opinion these sound better than my Airpods Max.","The sound quality is excellent with a good balance of low, mid, and high frequencies.","As long as all devices are signed into the same iCloud acct you can move the headphones from device to device with no effort.These Sony headphones are cheaper, sound better, and are lighter and more comfortable to wear than Airpods Max.Highly recommended.","It has amazing sound quality, I don't know how to describe but this is the best headset available in the market right now.","This si my opinion after one month of use and i am very disappointed.Pro - Good Noice Cancelling- charing battery fastCon - Head band very, very unconfortable after 1h of use- No folding, the new case is much bigger.l- No NFC for connecting with phone- Sound not a big difference from XM2- designSomehow i like the new XM5 but is not better than the XM2 which is much older.First of all the confort, is terrible, the head band is very narrow and and not so soft like the XM2 and i believe XM3 and XM4 are the same.In matter of sound quality you have to listen very carefull to notice a difference, if you think are 3 generation apart you expect something better.You can't fold them, the new case take so much space.On the XM2 i had NFC and i just touched the phone to the headphones and the connection was super fast, super effective.Not anymore with XM5.My personal opinion if you have Sony XM4 or below the XM5 is just a waste of money.","It's not the most natural-sounding, but it does the job.And everything else feels like the regular incremental upgrades you get between generations.","Again, sound and ANC seem superior to the XM4 to my ears.","If I had to pick between the two at their price points, I'd go with the XM5 strictly off the new design, but if it's sound-based, they're admittedly not too far off each other.","It also has a long range.5) Long battery life and charges fast.6) App features/options - Several options for customizing EQ settings, noise cancellation, transparency, and so on.7) Multiple device connectivity8) I adore the color Sand (white).9) Sound Quality.","To make it sound even better.10)Much Better Microphone than the previous generation of the XM411)Touch controls shifts seamlessly between swipes and taps.12)Hard Case & Wire – The case is of good quality, the headphones fit perfectly, and there is a slot for a USB C charging cable as well as an audio aux cable.13) The Sony app is packed with features.","It's high quality, with amazing sound quality, is easy to use, is customizable, has many features, and a long battery life.","I slip these on and all I hear is my music or TV :) Which is exactly why I upgraded after only 14 months.Sound quality is great.","I had to use the equalizer from the getgo on the X4s, but I love the sound profile of the X5 \"out of the box.\"","Sony WH-1000XM5 Wireless Industry Leading Noise Canceling Headphones with Auto Noise Canceling Optimizer, Crystal Clear Hands-FrSound wise this is just as good as the previous model.","I for once can't tell the difference between the models, they both sounds great to me.Noice cancellation is real good.","It kept falling when I walk around with it.The sound is not loud enough for my bass taste.I’m returning this.","Best sounding headphones I have ever bought and the noise cancelling is really nice!","More comfortable, better isolation, cancellation, much better sound quality and better build, superior design.","The MX5 sounds good and the ANC was effective, but created a sense of pressure I didn't like.","The noise canceling is absolutely unreal, the sound quality is top tier!","And their voice sounds far more natural through my Bose.All around just really really disappointing, and I'm shocked these get Such great reviews.","It just wasn't my kinda of sound.","Was hoping Sony would improve on the sound front, and it is marginally better than its predecessor, but still not there imho.","And the sound is fairly decent.","In top of all the good stuff, i am totally in love with the option of connecting 2 devices at the same time.Watching TV not worried at missing phone calls, and when I answer the sound is so clear and other side can hear me so clear","Bottom line; they are not even close to the sound quality I was expected.","The best way I can describe the sound is flat and unimpressive.","Now this is how audio is supposed to sound!","The M5s make the AirPods sound like a basic pair of mid-level headphones.","The sound quality is extraordinary.","The sound quality is good and noise cancellation is excellent .","To get sound back you have to turn the headphones all the way off by holding down the power button, then back on by holding down the power button again.","Excellent sound and ANC.","Pros:Great noise cancellation.Great microphone quality.Cons:The sound signature tries to be a jack of all trades but master of none.","When making calls my own voice sounds muffled and it amplifies the background AC fan to sound more like a hairdryer.It gets noticably warm but not too hot.","I can't speak to the noise cancelling or the sound because the discomfort of these headphones overshadows all of that.","I was excited to get these and update my sony 1000xm2 which I've had for 5 years and are still working pretty well.The headphones are comfortable and the sound quality is good, however I'm dissapointed that the noise canceling isn't as strong as the sony 1000xm2.","After month or so of use.Pros:- Very good ANC and sound quality compared to Bose.- Best user experience.","If you want something LOUD, with a BOOMING bass, and crisp sound quality I recommend you get yourself a SkullCandy Crusher Evo headset.","This product eliminates almost 95% of that sound, where it makes it bearable to be in the office.","The quality of the sound is great, much better than anticipated with deep lows and good mid to high range.","Just like the sound of silence.","The noise cancellation works extremely well and the sound quality is incredible.","The sound is amazing and the noise cancelling is better than the QC35s.","Being able to activate ambient sound for the announcements will be awesome.","The ANC is very good, but still a bit of faint ambient sound.","I’ve had them not even 20 minutes and the sound quality/noise cancellation has improved drastically.","These headphones are great, aside from two big problems that could be fixed with a software update:  1) Sony needs reduce the Bass Boost low-pass filter internal setting down to 80Hz or let us adjust it manually as it’s current hardcoded setting is so high that it really trashes the sound quality of the music.","Awesome sound quality and noise cancelation.Well worth the price.","Music rocks, clear, good base great sound stage.","My voice sounds great over phone xalls.","But if hot out can make ears sweet, cups have no ventilation but that results in great sound and noise cancelation.","The sound and microphone quality are great as you would expect.","Sound quality is also phenomenal, very happy there.I live right by a road with a lot of traffic, and I like to sit out back.","I've started using noice cancelling headphones to block out the sound of traffic.","Your experience is much more likely to mirror those than the negative reviews.Amazing noise cancellation, great sound quality, and comfortable enough to wear for hours at a time.","Quite an upgrade from the xm4sBetter sound and noise cancelling but the new case sucks.","Very comfortable and great sound quality.","Okay, the good, the sound quality is decent.","Great sound and noise canceling.","Noise cancellation and sound quality and EP as advertised!","The sound quality on these is really good, but not exactly up to par with some other comparably priced headphones.","I have the Sony XM5 and the Bose QC45.XM5 definitely have better sound quality (the sound is more exciting, bass is amazing).BUT, and this is a big BUT, these are super uncomfortable.The earcups are super shallow, your ears will be touching the inside fabric and your ears start getting hot (really hot) even while sitting.I can’t imagine what will happen if i use them during exercising.The sound quality is not so much better than Bose QC45 that i will tolerate this discomfort.Bose QC45 sound might feel a bit dull compared to the XM5 sound, but the comfort is unmatched.Will be keeping my Bose QC45 and returning these.Really wanted to like these, and they do sound amazing, but the discomfort is a deal breaker.","I've previously owned all generations of Sony's flagship WH-1000 headphones and have always been impressed with the sound and the noise canceling feature which is primarily what they are renowned for.","Sony's flagship headphones have certainly continued to evolve and these are a really amazing evolution.The sound of these headphones is really amazing.","The sound is amazing and if it weren't for the two issues above it would easily be a 5-star product.","The sound is OK but my old Bose were, I think, better.I have a big head (not in the ego sense) and these fit comfortably.","I liked the way sound quality is improved.","TL;DR: *ALMOST* plug and play, noise cancelling second to none, amazing sound quality.These are the first expensive headphones I have ever purchased, and I must say, never have I experienced music like this before.","All in all, if you're looking for some quality headphone that will get you through that midnight flight, look no further.The only negative note that I could find is that initial setup may be a little bit tedious to get it just the way you want it (Account, Assitant, Noise Cancelling, Ambient Sound, linking music provider, Adaptive  control?, and a bunch of other stuff).I know there are audiophiles out there who will tell you to get \"X\" brand because they're so much better or so much cheaper.","Making them tighter, though, only exacerbated the pain on the top of the head.AUDIO QUALITY - The drivers have been reduced to 3 cm, and this is noticeable both in reduced maximum sound pressure level, but also much reduced impact.","However, overall, the headphones sound quite sedate, lack incisiveness, and generally lack the excitement of the prior XM series.ANC - The ANC quality is much reduced compared with the prior models in the XM series.","This is not user error where I have the ambient sound let through.","Overall the noise Canceling is wonderful and definitely won't disappoint.Sound Quality:I am by no means a professional when it comes to audio.","In my own experience I find that these headphones have great sound quality.","Overall it's great sound and definitely an improvement from the XM3.","Sound quality, noise Canceling capability, and comfort of the XM5s is just fantastic and its really a premium experience.","The sound quality and noise cancelling are very good and, if you don't have big ears, they're very comfortable.","I own WH-1000x M3, M4 and M5 (as well as several other headphones).I have to say that this headphones are very good, but they are less confortable than M3 and M4, even when the cup material is softer.Sounds is very good, and noice canceling is great.Not being able to fold them is a downgrade for those using them for travel.","When used with LDAC set at 990k and the Sony EQ app, the sound quality is quite impressive for Bluetooth.","I have tried turning off adaptive sound control, but it doesn't make a difference.","I decided to splurge on these but ultimately decided that they had some flaws that I was not OK with and returned them.Pros-I am not an audiophile, but the sound seems excellent-The Sony app allows you to switch between devices and even allow one device to be uninterrupted-The headphones seem well-built and feel sturdyCons-It took a while for the headphones to connect to any device once turned on and for whatever reason, they allows preferred my PC to my phone.","When I first got these I looooved them, sound quality is amazing on these and I love the touch controls as well as the noise cancellation.","The reason I’m giving this product 3 stars is because every time I went to switch a device the headphones would make this super super loud buzzing sound and they would do this for about 10 seconds and then just shut off.","Great sound quality for being Bluetooth.","So often when I try to swipe up to turn up the sound I instead input the command to skip the song forward or backward.","THE PROBLEM: I do not know if I have a faulty pair but in the past week of me having them (purchased 24 days ago) I have noticed twice now that I will be listening to music then suddenly I will be met with a jarring sound (nearly a screech) for around 4-6 seconds before my headphones suddenly stop my music and disconnect from my phone.","The sound is really good especially.","The sound quality is good.","They are great at canceling background noise, and sound really good.","New XM5 compared to XM4+Noise Cancellation+Call Quality+Battery Life+Charging Speed+Ambient Sound (Close to real sound)+Slightly More Comfortable+Many more minor improvements in hardware and softwareYou can reach me at my Insta for any information- imtiyaz.azhar","The headphones sound muffled and flat when using the wired connection.","However, Apple has led the way in disposable headphones...and other manufactures follow.The app equalizer is very good and a must to optimize the sound.ANC is very good.Connecting is an exercise in frustration.","Nice product and great sound quality.","Sound quality is bit dim but can be adjusted via sony app.","Comfortable with great sound quality.","Balanced sound output.3.","Everything is perfect, ANC, sound quality and app control.","The anc is not that great , you can still hear automobiles and children shouting in distance and any new sound that gets made immediately.","Also the dual connection of bluetooth is not good as it does get connected to two devices simultaneously but still the sound only gets played from the last device connected but it shows that its connected to both the devices.","Great sound quality and superb noise cancelling.If I have to pick a downside: the p2 cable port doesn't carry microphone audio :(This is the best phone you can by as for Feb, 2023.","It feels a bit over priced but the sound quality and the built is better than its competition such as Bose.","Noise cancellation, sound quality are all good, what you'd expect from this series and at this price.","It’s great but if you have an iPhone like me it’s a bit difficult to get used to it.Light weight and very comfy sound quality is great once you customize it.I can wear these all day!","It honestly took me a little bit to appreciate the audio quality difference between these headphones and my AirPods, cause they both sound great, but after a week or so the difference is night and day, they sound amazing!","They are soft and comfortable, great sound quality, and the noise cancellation is unmatched.","Sound quality is great.","I bought these for a trip to Japan and I must say the noise cancellation and sound quality are excellent.","No clue what causes this...but I don't think I can recommend these headphones anymore.ORIGINAL REVIEW (**** out of *****):I recently upgraded from the xm4 to the xm5.I had several issues with the previous version (main one being their flawed, slow multipoint BT connection which caused more frustration than the headphones were worth) but some things they implemented on these xm5s are a bit of a head scratcher.PROS:Great sound qualityGreat noise cancellingGreat fit/comfortLong battery lifeSlimmer and less bulky than xm4Better, but not great, multipoint Bluetooth connectionDouble click for spotify is awesomeCONS:Multipoint - still has issues and I have to restart either the headphones or the device it's connected toNot compact/No longer collapsable like xm4 - bummer for travelingHeadphone case is ok but much prefer the xm4 caseThe multipoint was so awful on the xm4 I gave up on them out of sheer frustration.","I've actual gone without them due to the size of this thing which is a bummer since the sound quality is fantastic.","Learns your environment of background sounds.","Outdoors in Wendy traffic general sounds completely blocked.","The app wants to charge you to get a better sound but really didn’t find much difference.","The app doesn’t give you any options to adjust for better sound.","My only real complaint aside from sound options is that they fit horribly.","I thought I'll try them out and if they don't sound great, I'll send them back.","Both the noise cancellation and sound are amazing.","Noise cancelling is still very annoying, I'll hear all the sound around me till it decides to kick in and block some of it.","**So this review is coming from someone who's worn the M3 Headset for over 4 years and I have to say, it's awful.I live in a place where there's sound in every direction.","Dogs barking, kids screaming, everything you can think of, and ANC is a requirement for getting any work done.So the good:- Ear cups are comfortable, doesn't crush your head after long periods of time.- Sound is good, not absolutely amazing, but good.","You need to download the Sony app to alter the sound to allow any bass to work, otherwise it'll sound static-y.- ANC is awesome but it's adaptive, which I don't like, but can be a plus for some.","When it worked it blocked out almost every single sound.- The case design is cool, it has a little compartment inside that holds the charger cable and headphone jack.The bad:- I'm used to my M3's cancelling noise constantly, this device would adapt to the sound around you, letting sound bleed through before blocking it out after.","Example: I was listening to a song at moderate volume, I could make any sound I want and I couldn't hear it.","Sound is superb, acoustically nuanced with great sound separation, spaciousness, and tight response.","You may want to adjust the EQ to your specific preferences, though it is balanced and brighter than the XM3 enough that is makes the former headset sound muddy after listening to the XM5 headset.","Coming from the WH-1000XM3s I was expecting these to be a great upgrade in terms of comfort, sound quality, and ESPECIALLY noise canceling but unfortunately that's not the case.","It drowns out small annoyances like buzzes and hums from electronics but its effect on voices and sounds around the same decibel level as a casual conversation and above seems to be around 50% effective.","I can still hear the typing of my keyboard, loud sounds outside, the TV show someone's watching down the hall, people talking around me, almost everything!","The sound is beautiful - clear, open, yet warm at the same time.","I've had the WH-1000XM3 headphones for a few years, and they're great - but comparing them to the XM5 now they sound muffled and closed-in!A massive difference is with the quality of the voice pickup, for calls and videos.","The sound is fantastic and the mic is perfect for calls and video.","Sound is absolutely amazing especially with the EQ.","Great sound quality, solid materials, great connectivity and range, but I have to return them.","The sound quality might be slightly better on the XM5s, a little wider sound stage maybe.","If I had my eyes closed and someone randomly put the XM4 or XM5 on my head, I would not be able to reliably determine which ones they were.That said... the sound quality is really good.","I'm not audiophile, but of the sub $500 headphone category, to me these are the best sounding headphones available.Noise canceling is amazing.","Otherwise, both have good noise reduction, good sound and similar adjustments once you do a download from each mfgr.","The noise canceling is great and the sound quality is clean.","The sound quality on them is very good for bluetooth noise cancelling headphones and the Sony app offers a good amount of customization of the learning experience.","Further their integration with Microsoft Teams on Macbook was completely unpredictable (sometimes the sound was fine, sometimes I'd have sound with no mic, sometimes nothing at all, and sometimes nothing for the first 10 seconds of a meeting then they'd suddenly start working).","Sound quality it good, however the headband hurts my head after long use.","The sound suppression is about 3/5 with loud ongoing noise the x3 model was better for that.","In re to WM1000XM5First of all I will start out saying these are very comfortable, and the sound quality is excellent with Bluetooth when functioning.Battery life is satisfactory the first month of use, although I hear the battery is not replaceable.Noise reduction - works very well.","1) Random turn off (not power or user interaction related, and not related to \"keep on while wearing\" setting, _OR_ (2) no sound is output for headphones even though PC shows connected, the player is playing.","Occasionally the sound will stop working here, and tapping the right ear piece in the game will start the YouTube player, but not connect you to the game sound, and sometimes the game sound starts working, and other times you get a mix of both.- Sound delay from sound being played on PC to the time it's actually heard on the headphones is quite noticeable at times and not a fixed but slowly varying quantity.","The noise cancellation is top tier and the sound quality is amazing but there are some really terrible flaws.","I bought these with high expectations and did love the sound, but the headband did give me a bit of a headache so ended up returning","Amazing sound quality.","Unbelievable sound and quality .","Can cancel the sound a bit more but I feel like I am in a surround sound system .Def recommend- I know it’s pricey but worth itOnly question is why would Sony make such a short charging cable!?","I don't consider myself an audiophile but enjoy good sound and have amassed a small collection of headphones anywhere from $50 Vankyo and Monster IEMs all the way to $700 B&O pair, along with Sennheiser, Bose, Shure, VModa, Sony, Jaybirds and others between those two extremes.If you'd rather not read a long review, let me quickly sum things up: these are by far the best all-around headphones I've ever tried.","Sound, noise cancellation, ergonomics, touch interface (on the headphones), Android app, carrying case are each great on their own.","Without this, sound quality will be significantly worse.","The former has excellent noise cancellation and the latter is the all-round pair with my favourite sound without noise cancellation.Noise cancellation seems on par or slightly better than Bose QC35, which is saying a LOT.","Sitting over wing, jet engine noise sounds more like a floor fan.","I find it really helps me keep normal listening volume and noticeably reduce fatigue on 3+ hour flights.Now onto the sound...","I personally have a slight preference for soundstage and overall sound profile from my VModa Crossfade 2's but this is very minor and very subjective.","At 330Kbps, these sound no better than Bose QC35 (which cost way less) and there's no comparison with VModa's that support Qualcomm aptX codec.","You can definitely save some money if you're willing to compromise in the area of noise cancellation or sound but I also think it's pretty easy to justify these Sony's if you have long commutes on public transit and especially if you have long flights.","In terms of its underlying hardware and spec, it's a major upgrade (from Sony's perspective I guess) but the real resulting outcomes are, well, far less substantial than it proclaims to be, at least for me.The overall sound quality for me is quite similar as XM4 is and that's a good sign; however, it does have a narrower or tighter bass for me and in general the sound seems slightly more refined with perhaps a bit more clarity in comparison to XM4.","The specific sound profile(s) that XM5 delivers certainly isn't necessarily suitable for all types of music and depending upon your preferred genre; you may or may not find XM5 appealing or even worthy of an upgrade (comparing to XM4).≡ SpecsWith respect to its specs, it's got BT 5.2 and dual QN1and V1 processors with a total of 8 mics with 4 beam-forming mics.","and balanced sound profiles.","It supports SBC/AAC/LDAC audio codecs.≡ Noise cancellationNoise cancellation works fairly well for the most part and it ain't noticeably better than XM4 for me personally and it heavily depends on the source of the ambient sounds, particularly the frequencies and I feel that its adaptive/auto noise cancellation does NOT work as well as I want it to be in a particularly chatty environment.","Of course, you can manually switch between ANC and transparency (allow ambient sounds in) mode via the button on the left ear cup.","Unfortunately, there are no ANC levels to choose from although the amount of ambient sound to let it can be configured.Strictly speaking though, there isn't any real [significant] difference with respect to ANC in comparison to XM4; they both work more or less equally well in most cases, particularly for higher (relative higher frequencies, not absolutely ones) frequency ranges.","In any event, its noise cancellation capability is amongst one of the best but it's unlikely to work in at all times for everyone (or even most people) because sound perception is highly personal.≡ FeaturesFeature-wise, it's got a similar set of features as XM4 but with minor improvements.","Likewise, it will automatically enable transparency mode to let the sounds in while pausing the music being played if you hold/cover your hand over the right ear cup in order to have a conversation.The 'speak-to-chat' feature (disabled by default as in XM4, press against the touch control with 2 fingers to activate it) is a step up from the 'quick attention' feature that automatically detects if someone is talking to you and would again enable transparency mode and pause the music in order for you to have a quick conversation.","I know the price is high but the sound quality is amazing!","I wasn't extremely excited about the performance at the beginning, but after I took some time to adjust the settings, I am blown away by its outstanding sound clarity, noise cancellation, and smart functionality, so be sure to play around with the settings to find what suits you the best.","When listening to music with the 360 audio, I've heard sounds form songs that I never knew existed or were meant to be heard in those songs before.","These headphones add a whole dimension to music and what you watch or listen to with these.Pros:- Incredible sound, noise cancelation, and sound isolation.- Incredible battery life which auto stop charging when the battery is fully charged.- Included aux cable to allow for instant sound transfer (great for first person shooters to hear footsteps and shots in the distance)- Sound quality is great and even the pass-through sound makes everything around you as if you weren't wearing anything over your ears.- Extremely soft and comfortable to wear.Cons:- They are very pricey, being $100 more than the precious model.- Since it uses AI to automatically change the sensitivity of the noise isolation, sometimes it let's too much sound through.- The speak to chat is kinda annoying because I've accidentally inabled it a few times and then you can't disable it without going on the app.","When it's inabled the moment you speak you can't hear any sounds from whatever you were playing through the headphones, you can only hear what's around you.All in all, if you can afford these headphones and can get used to the auto adaptation of the AI then these are definitely the best wireless headphones you can buy!","The app has multiple features and options to customize and change the EQ settings, the noise cancellation/ambient noise and a feature that I find really interesting: adaptive sound control, which automatically changes between noise cancelling and ambient noise setting depending on where you are/what are you doing.","Although the case is obviously bigger than my Airpod case, the sound quality upgrade and ANC completely makes up for it.","The ambient noise is very good but doesn't sound 100% natural during conversation with others.","The noise cancelling however is top tier and completely nullifies most noise which is amazing when doing work.In conclusion, these headphones were a league above earbuds in terms of sound quality, comfortability, ANC and NC.","- The XM5 is one of the lightest headphones, so it should be great for long flights.Sound: - The XM5 sounds excellent.","I am okay with it, but some may hate this.Ambient: - The app offers several options for ambient sound with 20 levels you can choose from.","Do note that the higher levels amplifies the sound a lot and add a noticable hiss.","The sound is beautiful.","The sound of it on and off as well as the voice that tells you your battery life and stuff is nice to listen too as well.","The only thing is that it gets hot in the summer, but that's with all over the ear headphones.The sound quality is amazing.","I'm really happy with being able to customize my sound using the Sony headphones app on Android.","For the steep price of $500, I definitely want my headphones to tune every other noise out.The sound quality was crystal clear, it made listening to music so pleasant.","I don’t see any difference in the sound quality .","I was amazed at how many different sounds I was able to hear.","Tones, sounds, that were part of the song all along but that I was discovering for the first time with these headphones.","It will stop playing sound from your phone until you restart it.","These headphones had everything I wanted - ANC, two connections at once, great sound, but I couldn't keep them on my head for more than 30 minutes without the headband hurting the top of my head.","Love the simple hand controls on the right ear piece, swipe to change song, volume control, mute sound, etc...  great noise cancellation.","I really love everything on these headphones, great quality great sound and great nois cancelling.","-noise cancellation is wildly good-comfort is incredible with the vegan leather-great sound quality-took a step back from MK4 with no folding design- carrying case, consequently, is bulky and harder to travel with-for $50 less, you're just about as well with purchasing the MK4's but these are great and I would recommend","Sound wise, the Headphones I use at home are Audioquest nighthawk carbon and Sennheiser HD650.","Many players have EQ settings so that’s not a problem if the headphones sound right to begin with.","These sound very good.","I really love the sound quality and noise canceling of this new Sony WH 1000XM5 but I hate the tight fit and pressure on my head that I can't wear it for more than hour.","When comparing to the mx4 the sound is slightly but noticeably better, and same for the noise cancellation.","Sound, noise cancellation, build quality and comfort.","Sound quality is not bad.","It's great but I find the sound isolation a bit lacking, but overall is still a good buy.","I brought the white one originally but it had issue with buzzing sound and static, but there wasn't any issue with the black one.","I kept the bose 700, most comfortable, better sound and anc, best build construction.First impression, the material used felt cheap.","I am petite overall, so if you are a small person, the fit will likely be off.Sound was great, anc was great.","I purchased the Anker q35 at the same time, and felt the sound and anc to be comparable on both which was upsetting considering the price of the Sony.The Sony touch is EXTREMLY glitchy.","It would stop working, and I would have to restart it to get them working.The bose after some eq adjustments sounds better, anc is better, touch settings appear better.","The noise cancelation is adequate, but the ambient sound mode is poor at best.","The audio quality is muddy, if audio is your priority look elsewhere such as Shure.If Shure had better noise cancelling I would much prefer them.I like clear precise audio with a flat response, these have reasonably tight bass, but far from clear.I have tried the soundcore, the bass is wildly uncontrolled, the Sony's are far suppiorior to the soundcore.I use the geadphones in the shop with many loud machines, the noise canlling is adequate.","This has amazing sound and noise cancellation.","Sometimes when I adjust the headphone, sound stops while video is running.","Randomly volume and behavior of sound changes.","I use this for music, gaming, and working from home so I need to wear this for long periods of timeI've been using the Sony WH-1000XM4's since they came and wanted to upgrade to the newer ones.Issues:- The ANC is worse on the XM5 than the XM4, when you tilt your head left and right - sound seeps in.","After prolonged use (~3-4 hours) I get a headache from using it.Pros:- Sound quality is great, as usual.","These headphones are amazing after some adjustments.I find these EQ settings to be the best for neutral sound after spending over 25 hours with them.","I like how they feel, sound and cancel sound well worth it","When i do a bench press or any activity laying down, it keeps falling down but this is so far the best headphone i ever had from the sound quality and the battery life.","I could live with it, but reluctantly.I do like the softer command sounds.","Noise cancellation: +Sound quality: +Volume control: +These headphones are great!","The sound quality is great as well.","These headphones contained a very jumbled sound, muddied really.","The sound IS better on the Bose QC 45s.","Great Noise Cancelling, Good Sounds Quality.","The bass feels slightly off, but these sound better than any other wireless headphones I have tried.","She loves it and says fantastic sound quality and noise cancellation.","The microphone also sounded wobbled, I recorded multiple samples.","The sound is more bassy though, AirPod Max is slightly more comfortable for big ears, otherwise overall Sony is much better than AirPod Max.","The microphone also sounded equally good or equally bad on voice memo on iPhone.Also have tried Bose QC 35 II, QC 700, ANC is not comparable to Sony's, the sound signature is also not comparable, but QCs are much more soft and comfortable for big ears.",".. sound quality i like my air pod pro !!","But if you are in android phone , then you don’t have to worry lot, it sound excellent in android phone and laptops too.","The sound quality isn't bad except when I start using the mic.","looking for some decent sounding headphones.","Boy, am I ever glad that I did!While most of the references were about the WH-1000XM4, this newer model is even better!The Sound (most important to me): I have to admit that I was blown away by the quality of sound from the first testing.","It was such a difference, clearer and more “pure” sounding.","Acoustic, full on band, live recordings all sound fuller and richer (even more so with Sony’s 360 degree sound enhanced music!","A feature I honestly thought I wouldn’t need (I use my headphones mainly while I work from home), adds to the focus on the sound quality and keeps me from being disturbed by outside influences.Battery Life: Varies.","They revert to their stock frequency response profile when used wired, but the sound is much better than Bluetooth, of course.","The product is perfect and awesome.ANC is better then Sony buds.best sound quality.perfect for traveling.","Excellent noise cancelling, sound quality, and battery life.","Great headphones overall they were very light but im my honest opinion I like better the AirPods Max because they sound more loud and the spacial audio and I feel the the max are more crisp in sound than the xm5.","If that sounds annoying, yes, it is.","Both sound similar.","Haven’t tried the sound yet but they feel like butter.","Sound quality is great as well as noice cancelling.","BOSE's QC45 noise cancellation is better than SONY's, I can still hear the noise of children, but I can't hear it at all when I wear BOSE's QC45, but the sound quality of the headphones is very good.I'll keep it because I need a wired headset.","It keeps turning on speak to chat, and even the speak to chat is so f***ing oversensitive that it picks up subway sounds and coughs as me talking.Do yourself a favor and get the XM3 instead.","They sounded fantastic, so I'll give it 2 stars.","*edit: hadn't used em much past initial testing today, MY GOD THESE SOUND SO GOOD IT MAKES YOU WANNA SLAP YO MOMMADoes the very basic stuff headphones are supposed to well which is far too rare these days.Audio quality is amazing for wireless headphones, the mic actually works well so far (only tested for calls).Works perfectly without any tweaking, however I recommend taking some time to familiarize yourself with the Sony Headphones Connect app - it allows some seriously useful customization/optimization features, most of which are just checking a box and Sont does the rest.","My fiancée bought a pair of $60 headphones that have better noise cancellation than these WH-1000XM5 headphones that claim to be state-of-the-art, however, the sound quality of these headphones is unmatched.","I have listened to many different headphones and these headphones are the best on the market at the time of writing this review.They’re also lightweight and easy to carry for travel since they come with a case; the user just has to turn the ear muffs and reduce the band length to fit the headphones in the case.Just because these headphones have great sound and are perfect for travel doesn’t excuse the terrible noise cancellation.","These headphones have always sounded great but this takes things to a whole new level","To the core now, the sound is excellent as always with Sony headphones.","Meanwhile, be cautious when you cross the street with these on although I was able to hear some car sounds from larger cars.","The ambient sound was pretty similar to the previous(meaning it's good) but I'd say it's not as natural as the Airpods series(Airpods Pro I'm comparing to here since I'm too poor for Pro Max :).Up until this point, it probably seems like a 5 star review but the following would be my complaints.","++PROS+++ Paired easily to both my phone and PC (individually)+ Using Tidal as a music service to get high quality audio - sounds awesome+ The fit is comfortable, even for long listening sessions+ Good battery life--CONS--- The noise cancellation is good, but could be better- Setting up the multipoint connection (PC/phone simultaneously) was not as intuitive","Why with that smell I love the sound but the strong smell is disturbing.","I can say he is particular about sound and comfort of headphones.","He already has apple pro buds and Sennheiser, but didn’t have noise canceling over the ear phones.After using them for a week he called me to tell how amazing the sound was, he listens to live shows exclusively and like his music at volume 11.","I have had no issue of any drop at all.5) Battery/Charging - Long enough and charges quickly6) App features/Options - Multiple options to customize EQ setting, noise cancellation, transparency etc.7) Multiple device connectivity8) Love the Sand (white) color9) Sound Quality - Last but not the least sound quality is amazing.","But if you customize the EQ and bump little bit the Clear bass and treble it just sounds amazing.It's been 6 hours non-stop listening for me, I have played all kind of genre and they all sound great.XM5-Not so good1) Carrying Case - Case is little big, flatter.","With zoom it’s even more weird but I think that’s more to do with zooms interface than these headphones so I’m not faulting them here.Otherwise the sound quality is nice AF!","These headphones are only slightly more comfortable than the XM4, however they tend to let sound in and come off my ears when I moved my head around.","This may be fixed further down the road with a software update.I will say the sound is cleaner than the XM4 and sounds a bit more natural and well rounded somehow.","I am not an expert on audio but it definitely sounds a tad bit cleaner.","I had to get used to the XM4s sound profile again when I ended up returning these but they are still a great headset.","I think these could be 5 star with some better earpads and some software updates, especially if you dig the cleaner less bassy sound profile.","The XM4s still sound pretty good, and I would not recommend upgrading to these right now at this price point.","They are the most comfortable headphones I’ve had and the sound quality is top notch.","This also helps make the headphones much more durable overall.In terms of the previous generation model, put quite simply, sound quality is more in line with a neutral profile sounding acoustically tuned pair of reference headphones.","Also the sound profile of the previous generation WH-1000XM4s can be easily restored by using the \"excited\" EQ setting in the companion app settings.Those carbon fiber dual drivers, 8 noise canceling mics and custom audio co-processor Sony keeps referring to in the marketing materials, are genuinely significant.","I don’t notice any exceptional sound quality with these headphones (to my disappointment).","big issue in call.-Sound notification (on, off, pairing, connected), are so random, you don't know what's happening, and what's the status.","Still sound quality is great","But the best part about these is the sound quality.","Incredible 360 sound, excellent base, superb sound quality and amazing battery life.","It makes this somewhat scratchy sound when you move your head, which means the headband fit isn't made for users with eyeglasses.","Am not blown away by the sound quality but after tuning the equaliser settings, I am happy with it.ANC is top notch, it’s definitely best in that category, maybe beating even AirPods Max.Quality of materials used is right for its price, can’t expect more but the cushioning is just great!","Very satisfied and the sound quality is great as well.","The sound cancelling in these are amazing, as is the sound.","The sound is simply great.","They sound slightly better too, their design is amazing which helps in a better noise canceling experience and they have different system sound for turning on/off etc.","Good quality sound, ease of use and comfortable to wear for long periods.","Sound great, just not liking the automatic noise cancelling feature switching itself at random","Pros1) ANC (but not mind-blowing)2) Bluetooth Connectivity3) Touch Control4) Mobile Application with loaded featuresCons1) Sound Quality isn't that great for this price range2) Bass is minimal","I love everything about these headphones -- noise cancellation, touch controls, transparency mode and sound quality.","I've had these for about 2 months, with heavy use.They have have excellent sound quality, battery life, and build quality, but basically everything else about them is crap.","Most automatic/convenience features are nearly unusable.The noise cancelling works well for low pitched sounds, but does virtually nothing for higher pitched sounds, and cannot be adjusted.","Fortunately the passive sound insulation is pretty decent.The software interface is pitiful.","They say the new carbon-fiber material and tinkering with the tuning makes it sound better.","Perhaps, but why didn't they just use the new material AND keep the 40mm drivers, as a larger driver will normally yield stronger sound, though some may say it's not necessary.","While the sound and NC are still excellent, the \"oomph\" or power of the 40mm drivers they used in previous models is not there.","Finally, the Ambient Sound issue people are mentioning is a problem, as it keeps adjusting on and off and cannot be controlled.","First a knocking sound started in the right ear when shaking, or driving in a car over pot holes and the headphones no longer sat tightly against my ears.","Then they twisted until the wires connecting the headphones completely sheared off, that that point it didnt charge, turn on and although sound came from the left ear with aux it obviously could not work in the right ear.","Things that have not worked so far include putting the headphones on a heating pad set to about 110°F overnight, wrapping them in said heating pad overnight, using a blow-dryer for 30 minutes (all I could stand w/o noise cancelling).My environment is not hot or particularly humid, I mostly am at 68 to 72° and 40 to 60%RH.I would give 4 stars for sound if not for this issue.They sound ok, but not as good as my big cans or my KZ ZSX & FIIO BTR5.","I did try driving these with the BTR5 and they do get a little louder, but sound essentially the same, the same sound and the same faults with the sound.I do not wear these for exercise or where I know I will sweat, but they should be able to handle whatever normally happens from being put on a human being's head for 16 hours a day.This is just not a problem that a state-of-the-art headphone should be having.","The sound was great noise definition great but I had to return three times due to not charging one time the charging port melted.","They sound amazing but the top of my head is literally sore from wearing them.","Do keep in mind, the sound will not be as good as when it is powered due to the electronics not actively EQ’ing out the deficiencies of the driver.","Moving over to transparency mode and I find that the AirPods Max slightly edges the XM5s in the sense of naturalness to the sound.","It simply sounds more like I don’t have a headphone on my head with the AirPods Max more so than the XM5s which sound a tad bit processed.","I can still however, easily hold conversations on my XM5s transparency mode with my co-workers at work or hear announcements on the train platforms.Call quality between the two is also excellent but the XM5s edge out the AirPods Max in the ability to literally make you sound like you’re in a quiet room despite there being wind or noises in the background.","Great job!Lastly, the sound.","I would describe the default sound of the XM5s as warm.","The XM5s midrange also has more fullness to it which makes the overall sound more in your face and vivid.","The XM5s bass is much, much improved over the XM4 and now sounds very tactile, precise and still full of oomph and power.","The AirPods Max bass is more emphasized in the sub bass, with a flatter and more neutral mid to upper bass response and also has a precise and tactile sounding bass profile.","Soundstage between the two is great but the AirPods Max sounds a bit airier and spacious even after EQ'ing the XM5s.","Details and subtle nuances sound a tad easier to hear on the AirPods Max as a result as well.","The XM5 is still no slouch and music sound very detailed and clear despite the warmer turning which just shows how well controlled the XM5s speaker is in its transient response.","So, while the AirPods Max is the more neutral and slightly clearer sounding option, the XM5s is the more punchy and smooth option.","All in all, I can live with either the AirPods Max or XM5 in terms of sound, but if I had to choose, my preference is the AirPods Max because I tend to prefer a more accurate and spacious sound.","Like stated before, the XM5 can be EQ'd to sound neutral (And it sounds amazing when EQ'd btw) but the soundstage still lacks a tad bit compared to the AirPods Max.","Soundstage can't be EQ'd since it's an inherent part of the physical speaker design.","The XM5 is the more versatile option in terms of sound because of the EQ since you can turn them from bass cannons to flat and sterile very easily through the app.","AirPods Max's available EQ option is simply presets within the Music settings for iOS or a third party app which neither will store the adjusted sound to the headphone's memory like the XM5s.","A quick mention is that I find that the XM4 sounds overly bright and boomy in comparison to the AirPods Max or XM5 even after endless attempts of trying to EQ them using the app.","Sony really improved the quality of sound on the XM5 and they are the best sounding yet in the WH lineup.In conclusion, the AirPods Max and Sony XM5 are at the top.","Not worth the price previous generation sounds better in noise cancellation and volume control.","Bought them for my first ever expensive headphones but honestly paying 400+ for them ain’t worth it, the series before them sound way better and have better volume","The most noticeable is the sound quality.","I have listened to sound through my iPhone, iPad and TV.","Within 5 minutes of pairing, the sound crackles and is horrible.","I did return them an got the bose QC45 which are way more confortable with a compromise to sound.","Sound quality for music and movies3.","Look great sound great, battery, only downside is the price but if this is your budget get them.","Like the features, very good sound quality.","Been really enjoying the headphones: the bluetooth multipoint support is really nice and the build and sound quality is decent.","The sound is good but if the cups were made out of something denser it would noise cancel 10x better.","It gets rid of almost all the background noise including the awful piped-in sound.","The sound quality was SUPERB.","I love the sound quality, it's really easy to set them up and the Sony Headphones app offers great audio customization.","Three days later, can't get sound out of the left ear.","I would be listening to music, and the sound would stop abruptly in the middle of a song or a video.","But there were no in depth instructions on what the different buttons are for.It did, however, push for the 360 sound that you have to pay a subscription for.","Although the sound is better with the 360.","My iPods have better sound without a subscription.As far as noise cancellation, it worked the first time.","Bose have been my go to head phones I actually sent the Bose 700 back because they were lacking in sound.","The Sony xm5 sounds great and are comfortable but the the sensor control on right side only works half the time.","The sound quality was great but the material feels cheap.","Every day, especially during video calls, they stop playing playing sound, or recording sound, or both.","The sound quality and noise cancelling are great, but I just can’t seem to get them loud enough.","Sound quality is the best I’ve ever heard, and with the app you can fully customize sound levels.","The sound quality is pretty good, and noise cancelling is not bad, but Bose 700 does a better job.","battery life is much more without anc … sound quality is amazing … just only 1 drawback that the leather ear pads are too much sweaty .. order a pair of velour earpads with them which would cost around 1500 rupees !","Noise cancellation, sound quality, battery life all get a 5/5, the ability to recharge the battery in minutes and last for hours is a force to be reckoned with.","This also means that if you turn your head too much, gaps appear between your head and the headphone, letting sound leak in.","They have excellent noise cancellation, great sound quality and they are super light.","Sony has downgraded from xm4.The only 2 good things in this headphones are fast charging and sound quality.Don't buy if you are looking for noise cancellation, comfortablity or upgrade from xm4.","sound is amazing whether watching a movie, playing a game, or listening to music.","In terms of sound quality, I am not an audiophile but I feel this is the one area where they are at least equal, everything else is a wash.- Noise Cancelling.","There's even an option on the app to send Sony a picture of your ears to improve sound quality (i guess?)","The sound, mic and ANC when it works are okay but I don't think these are worth all the issues that comes right out the box with the headset.I'm not sure if this headphones have an update that will fix these issues but my experience has been absolutely horrible given I spent so much money on the product.","Noise reduction in the airplane ended up being much more than 95%… you heard that right :) to me it felt like almost complete noise reduction, so much that I could hear my breathing and could lower the overall sound levels to below 50%.","Better than some sound isolation phone booths!Cons: ears can get warm but ok for airplane ride; voice passthrough for phone calls/teams calls is a little weird and takes getting used to; cost","As far as wireless travel headphones go, these are the best I've ever heard.However, I found that something felt 'off' to me in the tuning of the sound profile for these headphones.","Even sitting at my desk I would move around and notice outside sound suddenly leaking in.","The Sony app lets you manually chang between connection quality (basically makes LDAC the same as SBC ) and sound quality.","Optimizing for sound quality, is totally unstable and the sound immediately has pops, stuttering, and other artifacts.","The bass sounds so weird when you turn up the \"clearbass\".","And that was one of the selling points to me from reviews is that people say Sony has warmer bass feel.So, I end up with headphones that are unlistenable at high quality setting, and sound worse than my Bose.I returned them, heartbroken.Since then, I have some new Anker in ear wireless buds with ANC that sound better.","The sound is amazing, noise cancelling spot on, but the product manager blew it on one thing.","they are really heavy, not comfortable at all, The Sony WH-1000XM5, are very comfortable to wear, the battery last a long time, and you can pair them to 2 deceives at the same time which is a really neat feature if you are working in your computer and get a phone call, the sound quality is very impressive, the noise cancellation is good and ambient mode is descent ,  ambient mode is not as good as the airpods max, but considering everything else, I would go with this ones.","The sound blowed out.","Low end sounds fantastic.Mids and highs are completely absent.","It really does sound like a 25$ pair of headphones.The sound is relatively accurate though.","It sounds exactly as if the audio is muffled.","Bought noise cancelling headphones for my CPTSD (I’m sensitive to unpredictable sounds and I needed something to help me get through family gatherings for the holidays.)","The Dolby Atmos surround sound is marvelous.","It sounds like you are not wearing headphones at all.","External sounds on the Sony's are a bit muffled, and listening to your voice is irritating.-- Sound Quality: I found that both headphones have excellent sound quality.","For classical, it sounded flatter and tinnier than Apple's full sound.","For that degree of control, the WH-1000XM5s have a slight advantage in sound quality.-- Summary: The AirPods Max beat Sony's in several categories and remains my favorite headphones.","The better price, sound quality, and storage are likely noticeable enough to many that they would purchase them over the AirPods.","I can't imagine what \"loud\" is on these...- Sound stage is excellent.","I've disabled, but it still makes the touch sound...- Dog barking and people talking still leaks through.","Battery life, sound quality, everything is great!","I use these pretty much everyday, specially for online meetings and watching videos and listening to music on my laptop.➡️ Coming from Bose QC 35 I must say it's a huge improvement sound quality wise and the ANC feature.","While sitting next to my gaming PC with fans on 100%Pass through(7/10) putting your hand over the right ear cup allows for environmental sounds to pass through.","Which is cool but doesn't sound natural.Sound quality (10/10) amazing especially when tweaking the eq a bit.","Sounds are so crispy the bass the vocals everything was amazing.Build and comfort(8/10) not sure if it's our ears but the headphones sit on top of our ears.","Both headphones are not close in price but they do share the same features and are from well regarded brands.ANC- These headphones definitely have really impressive ANC, the sound is not the best but if you absolutely need the best ANC then these will probably be it based on so many online reviews.","Other headphones with ANC will often change the noice reduction as you turn because the mics are picking up new sounds.","Because these have mics everywhere, they are always picking up noice from all directions at once  and canceling it.Calls- The addition of mics also helps cancel more sounds while on a call and the voice detection looks to be doing a really good job at separating your voice for a really good call in a noisy environment.","The pads are most likely made of some type of rubber which still feels pretty comfortable.Sound- I had to update this section because the sound is greatly improved with the EQ, the preset ones are a joke but luckily the EQ is super easy to use.","Not paying attention to this is what gave me an initial bad impression of the sound.","I personally just gave it the popular V tuning and it sounds really good now with nice deep lows and satisfying kicks.One thing that I do have to add about the sound is that these sound horrible when wired, I’m assuming that they really heavily on their DSP for the tuning.","I connected them to my Fiio player which should have more than enough power and they just sound horrible.","So basically they sound good while their on and in Bluetooth but if you run out of battery and use the headphone jack they will sound horrible, luckily they charge super quickly.Comparison- I honestly prefer the 40s a bit more because they offer better sound despite not coming close to the ANC of these, they are not terrible but the ANC on these are next level.","The 40s also sound really good when using the headphone jack.","They sound good but not the best I’ve heard for wireless headphones.","I rated them five stars after noticing the EQ settings and better adjusting the sound to my liking.","As far as sound quality, I would rate the AirPods Max slightly ahead of the XM5, but it depends on what you're listening to.","But you can customize the sound profile on the XM5 quite a bit by using the Sony app.","Excellent headphones with great sound quality and noise cancellation.","Still have not gone through all the features, functions, and app but based just based off the sound alone I am extremely satisfied","Sony WH-1000XM5 is an awesome product in this category with great ANC, sound quality and extreme comfort wearing them.Looks are very premium, even to the touch of materials and cushion.","If you have used a premium TWS from pixel or airpods, it's a step-up even from the great ANC provided on these TWS.Ambient mode (transparent mode) is great at making the voices around sound clearer.","You can also adjust how much ambient noise should be let through (even suppress background noise and allow only voice frequencies through which is very good.Sound quality is really good, but it's very subjective, I guess.","Amazing sound quality, can wear it for long periods of time without strain, and the app has a lot of useful features","Sound quality is great.","Fantabulous sound plus it measures the pressure on your ear as per WHO recommended levels, which is phenomenal.","I love the noise cancellation on these, and the sound is fantastic, or would be.","I purchased the headphones 2 months ago and have been able to use them for maybe 2 weeks total.The noise cancelling is great, bluetooth range is wonderful and the sound quality was originally awesome.","The sound and noise cancellation work great but the design is HORRIBLE compared to the XM4s.You can’t fold them, they smack together when you pick them up like the airpod pros I returned, they adjust with the slightest movement.","Blocks all the sounds from loud cars, loud music (in cars right outside my window), Loud talking and walking neighbors.","They seem to be pretty decent overall - sound is good, noise canx is good.","I liked these headphones a lot, but within the first month of use the right ear started playing little crackly sounds that were louder than the music.","I suppose the sound quality was fine.","First, it should be said the XM4s are superior to the Bose QC-35s in comfort, sound and ANC.","The headband is slightly less comfortable than the XM4.Sound quality is an improvement that was noticeable.","I'll keep them, but the XM4 I personally wouldn't upgrade to the XM5 for the slightly better sound and cancellation.","Sound quality is amazing and the noise cancelling on an airplane is almost unbelievable.","The EAH-A800 are better at noise cancellation & ambient modes  and have great sound reproduction & best of all I can wear them for hours with no discomfort.","Yes Sony does a lot of advertising but the Technics are made by Panasonic and they have a great history in reproducing quality sound.","I can't even hear the noisy (~60dB) fans on my computer with these headphones on.Noise cancellation is improved, but I did find it had some issues with (1) eating (where the jaw bone is moving the ear cups) and (2) moving your head side to side (getting some false noise readings where the surface is sound absorbent, like an airplane seat).","The noise cancellation and sound quality are superior to similar Bose headphones in my opinion.","Functionally, it is on par with the M3 and M4.Sound-wise, it sounds about the same - no complaints.The noise cancellation, however, is not as good as the M3 or M4.","This was very effective and I had no complaints.The M5 seems to dynamically determine environment and cancellation by constantly sampling sounds in the environment.","The sound and noise cancelation is very good.","When I am listening to something on my tablet, if the sound pauses for even a microsecond it always switches over to my TV audio device.","It checked all the boxes in terms of sound quaility, noise cancellation, and volume control, but it would slide off my head from the littlest of movement.","Sony has the lead in that category.Sound was better at default settings than the XM4 but I have several options I prefer such as the Shure Aonic 50 (good out of the box with a class leading EQ) and the AirPods Max (I really like their sound signature but it isn't for everyone).","The EQ in Sony's class leading app improves the sound (for an easy adjustment I recommend \"bright\" then adfjust to taste if needed) but not to the level of the other two options.","To be fair if you like the Sony XM sound you'll like these as it's an improved version of it.This is a good product but it wasn't for me only because I have at least two better options.","They sound great but I think the noise cancellation option is better on the xm4.","When Inwas sitting in a hotel room I suddenly got a weird sound on the right part of my xm5.","Overall regret this purchase relative to bose.Pros:- Look good- Sound quality is OKCons:- Active Noise Cancelling is an absolute joke on these.","I did configure the app, and turned off the adaptive sound control so I ould keep Noise Cancelling always on.","The quality of sound, noise cancelling and Alexa features out performs the rest.","The sound is amazing and noise cancelation is crazy.","Very functional, Good sound, not fantastic but still good.","The Apples worked sounded great in an Apple Genius store full of customers.","Love the sound quality, noise cancellation is comfortable and it doesn’t feel like i’m in a vacuum, battery life is impeccable, mic is great (very good at voice isolation) and honestly they look so cute.","Highly recommend, if you’re really noise picky the app does have its own equalizer and plenty of sound techs have publicized their preferences for these specific headphones!","Seamless connectivity switch between 2 devicesWorth the price tagSound quality-5/5NC-5/5Battery-5/5","Its definitely an upgrade for sure, the anc and sound quality are a tad bit better.","Couldn’t test noise cancelling or sound because they were enormous.","PROS:-highest rated overall headphones for 2022 for comfort, sound quality, mic quality according to some on youtube-comfortable-decent ANC-honestly pretty muddy sound qualityCONS:-no mute function for the microphone-\"customizable buttons\" in the app dont have any actual options for the functions-no fast-charging-really good microphone, stays connected to 2 devices better than bose* returned mine because i need the mute mic function.","The silly \"adaptive\" sound cancellation \"feature\" constantly causes noise cancellation to turn on and off, at roughly 10 second intervals.","Best setting if coming from XM4's is ExcitedThey can be more comfortable and all but NC is way weaker than XM4's in trains and you CAN'T DEACTIVATE the \"Auto NC\".. not on the settings, not Ambient Sound, anywhere... You van set everything to Noise Cancelling but it still changes automatically MESSING UP THE EXPERIENCE.","Excellent build quality.Very good sound.LOUSY NOISE CANCELLATION!I returned them because of that.","Clear rich sound and unbelievable noise canceling","Noise cancellation worksWell; sound quality best in class","They also support LDAC via Bluetooth with ANC  & they sound phenomenal!Now I actually did buy all of these myself, trust me I wish Sony would let me test and/or review these things!","I EQ my headphones, so after that, they both sounded good to me, so not a significant enough difference there.","XM5s we're marginally more comfortable, but not enough to make a difference to me either.The couple things that were much better was it's ability to auto pause when removing the headphones connect to 2 devices at once (XM3 doesn't have that), the ambient sound mode was so much better, and the headphones overall responsiveness to touch/button controls was much faster.As for noise cancelling, I'm convinced that there is variation in noise cancellation strength between each individual pair of WH-1000XM5 headphones.","I've watched videos of sound engineers doing noise-cancelling samples and graphically showing the XM5s beating out other headphones, including the XM3.","Sound is pretty good but these are so light almost plastic feeling.","I like the feel, comfort, and sound coming from the XM5, but bluetooth can be spotty if you have multiple devices paired to this.","Im assuming this would happen to these as well.I’m sure there was a ton of tech that went into them, but at this price point I expected much more in terms of comfort with the ear cups and headband.Sound quality is amazing, but again, comfort shouldn’t be an after thought at this price point.","(headphones to some) While the sound quality is GREAT, Sony falls flat on their face with their current adaptation of what at least some of us require.","I love the touch controls, the NC is great, the sound quality is quite good and the battery lasts for a long time.","In terms of the previous generation model, put quite simply, sound quality is more in line with a neutral profile sounding acoustically tuned pair of reference headphones.","Also the sound profile of the previous generation WH-1000XM4s can be easily restored by using the \"excited\" EQ setting in the companion app settings.","The noise cancellation, sound quality and battery life is amazing!","The sound quality is amazing and the noise cancellation is fantastic.","The price is steep but the performance and sound quality is outstanding.","Ear buds fall out, leak sound and fail to provide adequate noise cancellation.","Comfort, hours of use, excellent sound, touch features, noise cancellation, no external sound leakage, ease of use.... the list goes on...","Charges quickly.Sound - I’m not into headphones and know nothing about sound quality but I like what I hear with these after playing with eq.Operation - speak to chat doesn’t always work but when it does it’s amazing.","It does not block 100% of noise, but it is probably the best I’ve ever tested.Battery life is as expected, but if you like it loud with max noise canceling as well as the DSEE Extreme and Equalizer enabled the battery life definitely takes a hit, but is still good.Sound quality is really good.","Overall, these are first-rate headphones and I would highly recommend them (even over the M’4’s as I like the new design and the sound quality, to my ears at least, is improved over the old model).Update: September 27, 2022.","The sound quality is amazing for my unprofessional ear.","I ordered these and a pair of Oro Sound Tild Pro headset and these outperformed the tild pro which had an actual boom mic and has amazing reviews for noise cancellation in the microphone.","It has an equalizer and allows you to customize the amount of ambient sound that comes through.","As I said I’m not a big audio nerd but the sound quality is the best I’ve experienced in any headphones and I own more than a few pairs.","Any audiophile knows the experience of when you get something that noticeably steps up your sound, you can’t help but go through your whole music collection to re-listen to everything because now its better.","sound I have.","But nothing has made me fall in love at first sound until now.","I am a firm believer there is a true sound at first ear for everyone and this is the one.","As the sound pours through my ears with it soft whispers and vigor bass, I am at awe and excitement at every song, music, and instrumental I have heard before, but now it is uncharted territory for my ear pleasure.","Neither B&W set has a true eq (bass and treble only) but the sound is very good out of the box so I really didn’t mind.","I didn't like the sound quality at all.","Sound is astounding.","The sound quality is better though, but for the price you’d expect the noise cancellation to be better than years old models.","The ANC is unbelievably horrible with these headphones: if you come across sudden loud noises, you'll be met with a huge pressure wave in your ears and often still hear the sound come across loud.","The sound quality, the noise cancellation, the design and quality is just not up to par with the price that’s being asked for.","In terms of audio the sound system is so bright and is lacking some serious base sound which is disappointing to say the very least.","Whenever you adjust the headphones even a bit during a call, they stop working, and the only way to regain sound is to disconnect and reconnect them.","The sound is absolutely amazing!","They also cover your entire ear and the sound quality is simply so good.","The sound quality is nothing exceptional, and for nearly $400, Sony was gracious enough to include a ridiculously short (12\") USB charging cord that won't reach any reasonably close USB port.","The noice cancellation and the sound quality is good.","Ready for the best in class noise cancelling headphones with incredible sound profiles completely customizable?","Clear sound, no distortion whatsoever, signal transmission remains in-tact and stable at any given moment.","Adaptive sound is nice, it auto detects my environment and changes from NC and transparency.","Because I own all the latest NC headphones, I created a comparison below between the 2 best: Sony XM5’ and how they compare with Apple’s Air Pods Max.Sound Quality: Winner TiedI tested the XM5’s using Tidal and Apple Music using both wired and wireless.","I found the music quality on the XM5’s sound better on specific genres such as Jazz, Bossa Nova, Hip-Hop (90’s), Classical Rock, Symphony, and R&B.The APM are ahead when it comes to EDM like House, Drum & Bass, along with Pop and other computerized music.Both headphones are close for most genres, however the biggest difference I noticed between the two was Jazz like genres, with the XM5’s being leagues ahead.This is a tie because it depends on the genre you prefer.Audio Enhancements: Winner Air Pods MaxThe XM5’s offer 360 Audio Reality which is only accessible to less popular streaming music apps like Tidal, while the APM offer Dolby Atmos and Spatial Audio.","The audio library for the sound enhancement is also smaller for Sony with limited selections.Comfort: Winner Sony XM5The XM5 can remain on your head for long periods of time (several hours) without any discomfort given its lightweight feel.","When stationary, they’re fine, but when walking around and tilting your head, they begin to slip off.Features: Winner Sony XM5Sony offers an headphones app accessible from the App Store or Google Play Store which allows you to heavily customize your XM5’s, from building a sound profile, selecting audio pre-sets, adjusting noise cancelling, transparency modes and a great deal more.The APM on the other hand, do not have an app of any kind, besides the ability to select audio pre-sets from the music app you subscribe to.Transparency Mode: Winner Air Pods MaxThe transparency mode on the APM is unlike anything else; I can have full conversations that sound natural.","The XM5’s on the other hand are an upgrade from the XM4’s, but it doesn’t sound as natural as the APM.Microphone: Winner Air Pods MaxThe microphone on the APM is excellent; I’ve hosted hundreds of hours of business meetings and personal phone calls; the microphone is crystal clear and professional.The XM5’s on the other hand is an upgrade from the XM4’s and noticeable a lot better, but the APM are noticeably better.","The Sony’s offer a much better value.Conclusion:There are many factors to take into consideration between both brands, but ultimately, my heart is with the XM5’s because they sound better for the genres I listen to (Jazz) on a daily basis, and it puts me in the musical ‘zone’.","I used to stay near a railway line and the amount of trains going used to make it crazy to work.With these headphones and AnC , it not just cancelled noises for me but even the other person on the call could not hear any background soundAmazing stuff and go for it.","So I will sum my experience about this pair in three major areas Comfort, ANC and Call quality and Sound quality.1.","Sound quality:I have been using expensive earphones for quite a long time I have my audiophile 1more quad drivers, Sennheiser HD 202, Sennheiser Momentum wired earbuds, Oppo enco x and x2's so I believe I now have some understanding about how a good pair should sound, having said that The default Audio quality is decent also it varies which device you are connected, I wud suggest that you should use them with LDAC enabled all the time!!","Its pretty decent nothing mind-blowing but it can be tweaked for amazing soundgazmic experience using app, u can enjoy A.R.","Rehman tracks such as Dil Se and experience a variety of instruments audible suddenly.I woud not compare it with bose, Sennheiser Momentum 4, Airpod max, i believe sound is subjective and everyone has to adjust accordingly and be satisfied with their purchase after they have made an investment and not be disappointed due to subjective opinions other have.Concluding this very long review, these are a value for Money pair of Headphones, I got them at a good discount and hence I went with xm5s rather than xm4s.","I do miss the voice prompts which are in the XM3's but the battery level is still announced when you click the power button.Sound quality is great in both however going back and forth between the 3's and 5's, the difference is quite subtle to me.","A great test album for these for me at least is the Atomic Blonde soundtrack.","When someone opened or balled up a cellophane wrapper I could hear it clearly and I found myself checking to see if I had Ambient Sound on.","Sound seemed about the same although difficult to really  test the sound quality in those environments.I had a shorter 1 hour leg after this which I decided to switch to my new Air Pods Pro2's.","Sound quality a little lower but none the less quite enjoyable and clear.XM5's in general.","Still a phenomenal headset, sound great, cancel noise well enough to satisfy me and fit in my carry-on far better.","If you use spectacles, you won't feel comfortable with these, even if you wear it above your spectacles - you will lose the pure noise cancellation quality as sound enters from the space caused by the spectacles.2.","Overall sound quality fine, but anytime I clear my throat, talk, or for some random reason I am not aware of…the devise pauses my video.","Great quality sound and noise cancelling is top notch.","This means that if there is any change in noise around you whatsoever, these 'noise canceling' headphones will stop noise canceling and just blast your ears with the sounds coming from around you.","My Xm3's had no problem canceling out the noise, but these Xm5's stop canceling noise anytime it picks up any noise coming from me, such as the very, very, quiet sound of me swallowing, sipping water, talking to a mic, and sometimes even breathing.","The sound quality appears to be a downgrade from the Xm3's, but it is difficult to compare them fairly due to how terrible and intermittent the noise canceling on the Xm5's are.","This has happened to me several times while I was on the phone with someone!The sound quality and noise cancellation are amazing.","Sound quality was amazing though.","Granted I know that there are other more expensive than these ones but I am blown away by how dynamic they are and how amazing they sound.","Cons:- I cannot turn off system sounds.","I saved ~$150.- The case is huge.- It does not come with travel, air plane adaptors.- The phones are slow to connect fedora (linux)Pros:- Great sound.","It is not hi res audiophile good, but it is not far off either.- Noise cancelling is greatI have PTSD and random system sounds really hurt me.","I wish I could turn the system sounds off completely.","I can mute out most surrounding noise and the clarity of sound / my voice on video calls is top notch.","I own both the XM3 and XM4 models and I have come to really love both the sound quality and the extra features Sony has packed them.","It keeps track of how much time you listen at various decibel levels so it can tell you if you have been listening too much.Sound quality is of course very good.","I will start with the sound quality and it is magnificent!","It allows you to carry on conversations by pausing the noise cancelling function, the right headphone controls sound lsvel, forward and back, and they are super light.","The sound quality is superb with clean bass, really nice clear mids and good stereo separation during long listening sessions.","I use my headphones constantly so I needed something that would be able to have good audio quality, good call sound, good noise cancelling and somewhat functional.","It’s actually happened multiple times when I’ve been at full volume but the noise coming out of the headphones barely sounds like 3 notches.4.","I was under the impression my calls would sound clearer and sharper (for the other person) and the audio would focus on my voice a lot more than background noise.","9.5/10Sound quality-  10/10ANC-  10/10Ambient mode.","A lot of reviews and videos are already out there on social media for its features, will not comment on those things.•Sound quality out of the box (EQ) isn’t something wow on apple music or spotify premium!","!•The EQ customisation comes to rescue and improves sound staging drastically, m using a Custom EQ which I have attached in my review, it gives better sound staging.","Nobody does headphones sound better than Sony.","Great sound quality and software.. Could be priced better, not value for money product.","The sound quality is among the beat I’ve tried.","I think the sound quality is great for music, as long as you do not touch the equalizer.","If you try to boost the bass or try any of the presets, the sound is just wrong.","The equalizer makes things sound distorted.","Comparing them with these $400 headphones, the Sony headphones are marginally better in sound, not phenomenally, amazingly better, just a slight improvement.The supposedly automated functions are not automatic.","However, my voice sounds very synthesized and unnatural.","The sound cancellation and quality are superb.","They're lightweight, comfortable and I love the material!The sound is great: crisp, smooth and pops!I love the smart features of them pausing and playing depending on whether they're on or off your head.","Beta noise cancelling and sound quality on a pair of headphones I’ve ever owned.","These aren’t as bass heavy and has a more wider soundstage and just sound more balanced.","Wide dynamic sound good separation, great battery life, light and comfortable but I would enjoy deeper pads for my big ears but this would change sound signature, Like the EQ with LDACbut aptX HD sounds really good on Shure 50 when EQ'ed can't compare to planers as planers are more laid back Really enjoy the XM5","My screenshot shows battery life near the end which confirms the 30hr claim and from my experience, the comfort, noise canceling features, and sound all lived up to Sony's claims.Easy buy decision.","Much lighter, better sound quality, all while keeping to a similar control scheme and feel.","From the build quality to the sound these are the best brand that I have ever owned or used.","Awesome noise cancellation, great sound much better than my Bose Quite Comfort","Good sound quality (is meant for other music streaming apps more than Apple Music which I use) and noise cancellation when it works is nice.","Don’t really get the point if this when you can just press a button and either pause the music or switch to ambient sound.","For the price point, I expect the headphones to be damn near perfect, because of my job I have to wear these guys anywhere from 6-15 hours a day so every aspect of a headset is important to me.I am not an audiophile but they sound great to me, rich and stuff.","Great sound, and sound cancelling function, very confortable.","I reluctantly had to get new headphones as I felt my Bose Soundlink II were soon going to die finally (I've had them for many years and love them dearly).","The noise cancelling is great, sound quality is great.","The sound quality is great.","Nice balanced sound, comfortable to wear.","But no problem in sound quality.","The sound quality is comparable with Apple sounds engineered and Sony sounds truer.","Didn’t like the sound.","Best comfort, sound and ANC.","Much more comfortable, 15%ish better sound quality, and the customizable eq via the app is still amazing.","Also, the phones do show fingerprints easily, but wiping keeps them less noticeable.Sound quality is customizable with great eqyalizer embedded in the app.","Like that the sound control is in their app.","I got these for their noise cancelling and ambient sound options.","Poor sound quality and less than premium build quality are surprising coming from Sony but this life.","Couple the right hear with your hand and it temporarily pauses while your hand is there, letting in all ambient sound in.","There is an option that enhances both ambient sound and music at once.","Since I didn't own the last version, I was able to give this headset a fair chance and explore all the new, more advanced features and superior sound it has, and I love it so much!Also, did I mention these headsets can get LOUD?","I bought this product for my brother.Sound quality is excellent","Better sound than the 4 or 3.","Better than the 4's even.The bass is eased up with a more centered sound.","I have no idea what processed pop might sound like on these and don't want to find out.","Loving my worn down old Sony MDR-ZX750BN with a tattered head-band, but with easy controls and great sound.","Yes it has great sound but frequently something would trigger a silence then a sound like \"white noise\", Just saying the fault lays with us and not this new Sony headset.","They cut the interior airplane sound to literally nothing.","The sound quality is great, it is very comfortable to wear, and the noise cancelling feature works very well.","Sadly, one of the hinges broke and I can no longer use them properly, so I when I saw that the XM5s were on sale for 100$ less I instantly jumped on them, figuring they would be an upgrade to the previous generation, the XM4.I was not impressed by the sound, I firmly place them within the same quality class as the previous generation.I read that they improved on noise-cancellation and microphone quality.","Neither are they as portable due to fix sides, but the plastic material feels cheap, and the overall design makes them really difficult to wear when doing anything but sitting still, as they often shift or even fall off entirely, which was not a problem whatsoever with the XM4s!Overall, the sound is still great, but this is not what a \"new\" generation of an electronic device should be.","Top class bass and sound quality, I'm having a lot of fun with LDAC and high-res audio in the apple music.","To keep it short they are Sony headphones - they sound good.","This headphones produce excellent sounds for music lovers and mic is the best of best for everyday phon call , Teams with mobile Bluetooth working fabulous for office calls and ANC is top.","It had a very nice sound, good range of music type handling, wide soundstage, brilliantly executed noise control circuitry, high level of comfort even when listening for hours, marvelously executed connecting app were appreciated by me.","Lots of options to tweak sound, ability to handle phone calls and intelligent user-friendly features (only 2 buttons, customizable functions using the app, highly responsive touch controls, features such as interrupting music when in chat mode or cupping the right headphone to turn off ANC and music to carry out a brief conversation etc were very convenient.It seems well built and with some care should last a decent period.","The 360 Reality is a new feature with fewer sources available but even without it, the soundstage is airy and bright and added novelty to music pieces already listened to for years!","No issues with battery, sound quality, noise cancellation, Microphones all works perfectly.","I can see why this model was consistently near the top, the sound quality, touch controls, comfort, noise cancellation, battery life, are amazing!","Noise cancelling is amazing, sound quality and battery life are amazing too.","The sound quality is good.","Sound quality is fantastic  but my the padding is not thick enough and my ears touch the inside and it gets uncomfortable after a while.Also, the choice of material is questionableas it has a soft plastic covering the cups and within 5 min.","I got my new pair of WH1000XM5 today and I’m absolutely blown away by the sound quality, noise cancelation and comfort that these headphones provide.","These headphones allow me to tune out the noise while also giving incredible sound quality.","I also don’t notice an incredibly large difference between the sound quality in Bluetooth vs wired connection.","The design looks so much better than the previous models.Sound: Trust me when I say this, they sound way better than Sony Xm4’s.","It feels to me that Mark 4’s lost so much of details in the sound quality, when you listen to this.ANC: Noise cancellation has been improved by a lot.They still cannot cancel noise to a 100%, but well, no headphones can do it yet, but it is the best of any headphone out there.","(Airpods max is so close to this), close but not upto this.Transparency/Ambient mode: They sound so much better in this mode than Mark 4’s due to new improved number of mics.","Still cant hear 100% of the outside world (like you still cant hear a song playing in an uber as loud as it sounds without an headphone, but still make out what you’re listening to).","But I can wear these all day and listen to the world outside, it feels like its removing some useless noises of the real world and that sounds good.Cons: They sound a little better in Androids and pc/laptop with LDAC than on any iphone.","But that difference is almost negligible and I still decided to keep them for the iphone because I love the sound.Overall: They’re worth $400, and they’re still cheaper than Airpods max.","They're comfortable on, the call sound is good from both the caller and callee's perspective, and the battery life is impressive, using them for a few calls a day over a week, and I'm still at 60% battery.","Sound quality is good, balanced with decent bass and the equalizer on the app let's you fine tune a bit.Finally, I was shopping for new earphones mainly because I wanted the option to be able to plug them in (travel on a plane), which you cannot do with buds.","They sound really good","I didn’t know music could sound this good until now","So after I have have them for a month now I still can’t seem to get the soft key controls on the side ons the right ear to actually work on the pc I use on a daily basis at work instead I have to open the sound mixer which is a little annoying as everything I use is chrome based

to their small form factor, IEM's can use armature drivers where 'can' style headphones like this can't use armature drivers (not loud enough), but I would still like to see 2 dynamic drivers in these just to allow one driver to focus on the highs and the other to focus on the lows rather than having the one driver trying to play the whole shebang.- Minimal, but still present, \"pressure\" sensation when noise cancelling is on, but it's not intrusive like a lot of other ANC headphones I've tried and effectively disappears when music is playing.","I also assume they use a low density memory foam for cushioning which is great but will eventually need to be replaced or tended to if left compressed or squished for too long.Unique featuresNoise Cancelling is top notch but not much different than their previous lines in my opinion!","It is a standard these days to get noise cancelling and the headphones are great for drowning out noise if need be.","As a pair of noise cancelling headphones, you can expect to hear a positively good detail in music, movies, gaming or even a phone call!","My biggest priorities for headphones is comfort, sound quality (both for music and phone calls), and noise cancellation.ComfortThe XM5’s have ear cups that are slightly larger than the XM4s and they also look slightly larger than the NC700s.","I think I’d give the edge to the XM5s because they block out ambient noise slightly better than the NC700s, but the difference is negligible.Noise CancellationI mean, these are high end headphones and both do a great job with noise cancellation.","But because of the superior noise cancellation and sound quality, I’m going to be using the Sonys from now on.","But, if you can get past a little sweaty ears, or if you use them indoors or on airplanes, you should be a little excited.The Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones feature, what Sony advertises, “industry-leading noise cancellation.” And they ain’t lyin.","These two processors control 8 microphones for crazy accurate noise cancellation.","But the over the ear closed design may help dull annoying sounds.A very small cadre of people claim they become nauseous using noise cancelling headphones, and especially the old model XM4s.","You start speaking, and the XM5s automatically adjust noise cancellation to pick up the voices of other people.","If you want 100% Noise Cancellation, use ear plugs that are made for it not a pair of Bluetooth Headphones.","Having Noise Cancellation with music playing does help focus more on the songs.","That being said, it does isolate my voice quite well in a loud environment and the Noise Cancellation keeps me from hearing anyone talk though to how high I have the volume playing my content to immerse myself.","But like I said, without any content playing you can still hear stuff through the noise cancellation but once you play something else on top it’s gold.","I hate having to use my phone to change a few things such as the level of noise cancellation or shutting off/on the gesture control.","I recently had to travel and ended up wearing them for 6 hours straight!Battery life: The battery was full and by the end of my travel it dropped to 85% so the battery life is outstanding.Noise cancellation: It was really good and didn’t create too much pressure while on.","Noise cancellation isn't as great as the AirPods Max and neither transparency, but the sound quality was a little better in my opinion.","Automatic noise cancellation and voice recognition to allow for conversation is awesome.","Amazing sound quality, easy to turn on/off the noise cancellation.","If you only care about noise cancelling, these headphones are hard to beat.","Switching to these almost felt like a downgrade until I turned on the noise cancelling.","(NOTE: I do not recommend wearing these with noise cancelling off.","Plus you have to deal with the issues I mentioned before with noise cancelling being off.Also, if you plan to work out with these, don't.","Ok, I’ve had these for about 72 hours and as my title said, I’m still on the fence to whether or not I’m returning these.The PROS:*The ANC (active noise cancelling) is unparalleled in my opinion.","The noise cancelling helps so much by cutting out the ambient noises of the wind blowing past in the car or small talk.","This feature does mess up a few times and turns the noise cancellation down very suddenly when I’m listening in the car which is a bit startling but you can turn this feature off.","Maybe I just didn't know what to expect out of noise cancellation, but I am not blown away.","Noise cancellation is the best I've tried so far.","However, its the 700s would also lose the adjustment very easily compared to the MX5s when moving around because they rubbed against a headrest.Noise CancellingI won't focus on the sound quality because I am not an audiophile.","However, the noise cancelling is fantastic.","My 700s sometimes would refuse to switch and be stuck on one source until I would restart the device or manually disconnect one source.The app also lets you assign the noise cancellation double a triple tap actions to start a directly interact with a service like spotify.","The same button can also turn off/on noise cancelling but rather the headphones given a verbal sentence like \"Noise Cancelling 5\" to let me that I am in ambient sound mode.","The 700s would do and I miss that feature and they would also let you customize the noise cancelling levels that you could cycle through.","They’re lightweight, they look nice, the sound quality is nice, and the noise cancellation is amazing.","The product was well packed and arrived in good condition.Product Review:Pros:1. noise cancellation is great2.","The noise cancellation works so well.","These are, without a doubt, the absolute pinnacle of noise cancelling headsets...not headphones.","Let me explainI have never heard such amazing noise cancelling.","Sound quality was great, noise cancelling was solid, and initially battery life was fantastic.","The noise cancelling is good.","Other than that, the sound quality is not even half of what you get with an airpods pro, big sound leakage, noise cancellation is also similar to airpods pro.","The noise cancellation is 100% best-in-show.","I had a previous version of the Sony WH-1000XM5, and was excited to buy what I thought would be the best active noise cancelling headphones available today, despite their $400 price tag.","I'll have to say that the active noise cancelling is fantastic.","Continues on a bit of a muddy sound like the previous models, however the noise cancelling is superb and EQ options such as the custom Wavelet profile from soundguys make this an incredible all around headphone.Edit: After owning this for a few days I've noticed some issues.","Adaptive noise cancellation kills ANC capabilities.","Noise cancelling is awesome.","Cumbersome when compared to other noise cancelling headphones as well as HUGE case.","Many other higher-end noise cancelling headphones utilize the tilting headphone as the on/off activation which is easy, efficient, and preserves the battery.","The only thing these headphones really have going for them is their noise cancelling ability and battery life are good.","Through sweat & wind then noise cancellation held and the music was clear","If I'm across the room from my phone or computer, I want to be able to mute my microphone without having to walk across the room and search for the mute button on the program that I'm using.This is apparently a long running issue with Sony devices like this.These headphones are not good for use on phone calls, Zoom or WebEx meetings, or Slack Huddles because of the lack of a mic mute feature.The included microphones are mostly for accommodating the noise cancellation rather than for spoken conversation.Check out headsets from Poly/Plantronics for use with voice communication.I will likely return these headphones.","I like the compatibility of apple products but wanted great noise cancellation so I chose these.","Can confirm that the sound is great, noise cancellation is great, but I just could not wear these for more than an hour.","The noise cancellation is superb and it's very soft on the ears.","The pressure from the noise cancelling can cause me headaches, so i end up not using it much, the sound quality is good, but my biggest dissapointment is THEY ARE NOT LOUD.","PROS-Perfectly Balanced Sound Signature (Subjectively better than XM4)-Hands down one of the best Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) Technology-Lightweight and Comfortable (for X amount of hours)-Excellent Battery LifeCONS-Build Quality feels Cheap and Fragile-Earpads can Deform, get Hot (sweaty), and become Uncomfortable-Flimsy Case-PriceyOh wow!","The Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) in this headphone is simply one of the best in the market.","The sound quality is just excellent and the noise cancelling is top notch.","They'll turn right back on once I push the button, but multiple times now I've been mid-YouTube video, and they just...turn off.By far my biggest complaint, though, is the weak noise cancellation.","The low-quality noise cancellation is inexcusable given the cost of these, so they're definitely going back, and I'd recommend many other products over these, to be honest.","I've been very impressed with the audio quality so far.Noise Cancellation is good, but considering the use the same sensor as the last generation (XM4's had a single processor for this, XM5's have 2 of that same sensor), I was expecting a lot more sound to be canceled out.","I don't think it's a fair assumption, but I was honestly assuming that with double the processors I'd see double the noise cancellation and that didn't really appear to be my experience.","You do get \"more\" noise cancellation, but I don't think it's twice as good.","The XM4's were already impressive to me with their noise cancellation, so these do not disappoint, I think I just got a bit suckered by the marketing of \"now double the processors\" here!","There are minor differences in the noise cancellation but both are excellent and I’d be fine with either of them.","I tried the Bose from a less expensive to the most expensive and to be honest The Sony WH-1000XM series, from XM2 through the latest XM5's are the hands down absolute best from noise cancelling, sound quality and comfort.","I sometimes even wear them to sleep, though I wouldn't recommend that.Noise cancellation and sound quality: these definitely seem to be a notable improvement in noise cancellation over my previous XM3s, and with similar NC but better sound quality, compared to the XM4.","And they also have Sony's excellent noise cancellation — every bit as good as Apple's or Bose's for travel, though it lacks a bit if you are a fan of \"transparency\" mode — along with easy, ultra-fast USB-C charging.","You certainly can't fault them on sound, noise cancellation, or convenience.","Best sounding headphones I’ve ever used with the best noise cancellation.","I also tried the Bose 700’s, which sound great but the noise cancellation has a weird vacuum effect…the XM5s don’t have that.","Yeah, the noise cancellation is great while traveling on a plane…but even when you’re just listening to music around the house, the noise cancellation silences any ambient noise and makes it feel like you’re right there in the music studio.","In this app you can also set your EQ functions for the headphones with options for more base or more treble etc.One of the features I really love is the noise cancelling functionality as I was walking outside and having cars zoom by and even walking my dog around the noisy city the headphones were able to block out a lot of the noise and hear my music clearly.","Sound quality, noise cancellation, and comfort are all amazing.","Noise cancelling is great and works very well8.","Noise cancelling quality is amazing.","Really works around 30 hours on single charge with noise cancellation on.","Good :Active noise cancellation is fantastic!Fast charging is good, bluetooth connectivity is fine!The call quality is amazing.The app shows the SPL levels and it's effects on hearing which is awesome!Bad :360Reality Audio is a gimmick, should've had AptX HD, AptX Adoptive along with LDAC because with LDAC you cannot connect two devices at once.The outer plastic cladding near the foam pads push the frames and makes it a bit uncomfortable (those with specs are better off with XM4).Ugly:The sound quality is good when you don't EQ , but if you use their own apps EQ it's good only upto 70% once you increase the volume beyond it starts to distort and once you turn it all the way up the EQ just flatens and sounds like hot garbage.I don't hear beyond 60-70% volume but even if i want the volume to go to max the SPL doesn't go beyond 99db with any codec I've tried LDAC, AAC, SBC with their upscaler DSEE Extreme no change whatsoever.Also the change in volume beyond 70-75% is really not much and infact the headphones only start to distort!","The noise cancelling is great for frequencies like those of a fan or jet engine.","Now my main reason for buying these was because I'm going on a plane next week and needed something that was noise cancelling as i have sensory issues but was also looking for a new daily over ear headphone.","Coming from Skullcandy crusher evos, i obviously understand these are geared towards being a noise cancelling headphone and not a bass headphone, however I expected more for $500 of my own money.Additionally, these headphones don't fold and come in a larger case than 90% of other headphones out there.","Seriously Sony who thought of the no folding design?While they're very light and comfy, have great noise cancelling for certain frequencies, contain amazing call quality, have 30-40 hrs of battery and the touch sensors on the right ear cup are SUPER fun and easy to use, I would not buy these if you're also expecting great sound.","Noise cancellation doesn't work correctly in all noise conditions.It is not at all near bose experience.","I did not like them at all, their noise cancellation is not good, what is that the material of the headphones is of very good quality but I do not like it","I like the sound quality and noise cancellation.","This is my favorite one by far.I travel a lot and mostly use these when travelling, for conference calls on the fly, music, tv shows, noise reduction on the plane and so on and it’s simply perfect in all these aspects:- Sound quality is very impressive- Noise cancelling is top of the field- Voice clarity for the microphone on my calls is perfect for my coworkers- Syncing is a breeze- Controls are easy to get a handle onVery very satisfied with this acquisition.","This headset has outstanding features such as touch control, noise cancelling, it's cordless, rechargeable and it comes with a collaspable case with magnetic storage for the headset wire and Type-C USB charger.","These are amazing headphones  especially because I need to wear them all day for work calls, as i need to take calls while I work, good noise cancellations.","The noise cancelling is excellent as always, definitely helped out by the better seal of the new pad material, and transparency mode is better, albeit not as good as the Airpods Max.Cons: While I enjoy and understand the use-case for noise-cancelling audio tech, there are several choices about the XM5 that I have to question about Sony.","Great sound quality and noise cancellation.","The call quality is 100% as good as with a high end phone.Noise cancelling is great.","Summary:Very good noise cancellingTop notch sound performanceExcellent Bluetooth connectivityMore expensive than similar competitors, and even Sony’s previous generation XM4Does not fold into a compact shapeThe recently released Sony WH-1000XM5 (from now on I’ll just refer to them as the “XM5”) is the latest set of noise cancelling wireless headphones from Sony, building on the success of the previous model, the XM4.","The earcups do not fold inward to provide a more compact profile.There are 2 physical buttons on the left earcup, for power ON/OFF and Active Noise Cancelling ON/OFF.","Although the earcup padding seals out external sound fairly well, the headphones let you hear your own voice clearly by feeding it through the headphones.The noise cancelling works best on low frequency sounds, as is common with most NC headphones.","Sound is great, features and noise cancellation above mu expectations","A bit expensive but well worth it.30 hours of continuous use plus excellent noise cancellation.Also, does not disconnect or lose BT connection in crowded are with other BT be it in cars or headphones.","The headphones are perfect, with phenomenal noise cancellation, great sound quality and very comfortable.","The noise cancellation is first-rate, and about the best that I have seen to date.","One of the best noise cancelling headphones I have used.","I hadn't realized how much sound my refrigerator made until I got this.I have WF-1000XM3(the older ear buds) which supposedly have great noise cancelling, and having used them I can confirm they do that part well enough.","Noise cancellation is better than any I’ve tried and I work with high velocity dryers that are 108 DB and they just sound like wind in the distance.","If you own a XM4 already, you will be disappointed how poor the noise cancellation is on XM5.","With XM4, you would hear nothing on a plane when you put it on, but for XM5, the background noise is still there, you could definitely still say that it is noisey even after putting your XM5 on.Also note that, Sony have removed the control options for noise cancelling for XM5 which you have on XM4.Another thing, I really can't understand their logic why you would ever need less intense noise cancelling when the ambient is \"overall\" less noisey.","Good luck with your noise cancellation, your XM5s WILL decide that you are in a quiet place and only filter the tiniest noises (which you don't care about), but lets the noise which you would want it to block in.","Totally makes no sense to me.I want noise cancellation to just WORK, that's why I decide to put the headphones on in the first place, and no exception to quiter places.If Sony really needs to promote your adaptive BS for marketing, which is understandable, at least add an option to let your customers control how intense they want the noise cancellation, so your product can actually do the job.I am so disappointed with how the XM5 performs in so many ways, this is honestly so many steps backwards from the previous XM4 in my opinion (and yet more expensive).","XM4 can be set to use maximum noise cancellation settings to make a normal room quiet like a library archive room.","I bought XM5 expecting stronger noise cancellation because it should be able to do so based on the testing results I read online.No.","the \"automatic\" noise cancellation ruined its experience for me.","It is incredibly annoying to be sitting in a busy area working and then have the ANC turn to a lower power or completely stop noise cancelling.","Love these - amazing noise cancelling features, the sound quality is great and they're perfect for my very loud work environment.","If I have to give full mark, I will give it for noise cancellation(10/10) ,sound quality is also good as well as Bluetooth connectivity.","Very effective, perfect noise cancellation, great sound quality and battery lasts forever.","The VA will guide you on the further steps)- The Noise Cancelling (Bummer), The sound (Play the 360 Spatial Audio video on YT)- Volume at 60% should be enough for most people to enjoy the music.- Extremely comfortable to wear for long durations and these charge really fast.- The Bluetooth range is good enough to roam around a duplex without worrying about fades.- The app gives enough customizability freedom.","Sound better than my Bose and the noise cancelling is great.","Has a faaaaaaaaaaaar better noise cancellation.","This thing dynamically goes out of noise cancellation as soon as your head or jaw moves.","But it’s sooooooooo annoying.XM2 was far better in noise cancellation.And the sound quality?","The noise cancelling is amazing.","They do noise cancelling really well.","Noise cancelling is better than the XM$ at eliminating sound I used to get on the XM4 You'll get the same battery life as the XM4 also.","Extremely comfortable and excellent noise cancellation.","The noise cancellation works really well and I can barely tell they are on my head.","Noise cancellation is grade A when it's powered on.But the constant connectivity issues forced me to return it.","They squeak and scrunch with the tiniest motion of the head, destroying the purpose of noise cancellation.","The noise cancelling was good but the mic I wanted mostly for both Koch and noise cancelling.","The noise cancelling performance on this headphone is outstanding.","The noise cancellation is lovely!","I love that you can control the degree of noise cancellation and choose to focus on voices or the environment!","For noise cancellation, they do a mediocre job when it comes to predictable noise (e.g fans or lawn mower).","To me, these seem like the noise cancelling is not that great.","The noise cancellation is incredible.","I cannot believe how good the noise cancelling capability is.","These try hard and the noise cancellation is great, but the 360 sound is weak and just off..I got them for work, but the mics and connection did not do well with the limited use I did.Not bumming!The warning says no sweating lol, no problem these will fall of your head well before a sweat is broken, annoying.","First let’s start of by saying I’m seeing so many positive reviews by people who never owned the xm4 or previous models they sound like promo reviews by SONY if you ask me, so you can understand the frustration by people who have owned previous models, first let’s start with noise cancellation which is awful on the xm5 no manual adjustments to the noise cancellation, and the auto noise cancellation optimization is a zonk on this generation Sony you took something so simple and nice and just messed it up, taking phone calls with these headphones were great and battery life is always awesome with the XM LINEUP,  now let’s start with the clamping force on this one I find myself having to lift the headphones off of my head because the feeling is so tight never had an issue with the XM4, the build quality on this one feels okay and the touch controls are much faster and responsive on this generation, the ability to not fold on this generation is a zonk to me as well but it looks like Sony is going in this direction so this would have some getting used to as they are following the other competitors with their designs as well, sound quality is great not excellent as everyone has their own methods and ideas as to what good sounding headphones are, until the noise cancellation is fixed, clamping force and more comfortable pads I don’t see the reason to try to like these headphones because they are the newest thing out, these manufacturers are putting out junk and not ready products at the cost of my wallet","The sound is clear and the noise cancellation is on top.","The noise cancellation is top notch.","The only thing is that the automatic noise cancellation turns on by itself even if you manually turn it off in the app.","I've been using XM3 for about 4 years now.I skipped XM4 as I heard it's not much better than XM3.As for XM5, as I heard it's got phenomenal features, so I wanted to give it a try.For sound quality, it is definitely alot better than XM3-Its directional sound is noticeably better than that of XM3,And music/movies/games just sound so much better.Some of the really cool feature it's got are speak to chat and multiple connection features.Speak to chat allows me to talk to someone freely without taking off the headphones.Multiple connection feature allows me to switch from my PC to my phone instantly when I get a call, or play a video on my phone.As for noise cancelling, XM3 seems to have better ANC.I thought I was able to hear more noises when wearing XM5, but it didn't seem that far off.My biggest disappointment was its comfort.Due to playing video games on a daily basis for long time, I sometimes wear the headphones for 8~12 hours.","I would assume that a lot of people would like these headphones but I do like some bass and the mx4's do much better in that aspect.In terms of professional use, these come closer to the Airpods Max able to deliver excellent noise cancelling with passable transparency mode.Since I do have the Airpods max however, I didn't need another pair of headphones for professional use.","They sound AMAZING (Sony's rich and full sound is unmatched).They are SUPER lightweightThe noise cancelling is BETTER than the Apple Airpods max headphonesVery nice travel caseThe only reason I returned them is even on their smallest adjustable setting they were too big for my normal sized head.","Overall decent headphones but very buggy I had to disable the features such as pause to remove and the adaptive noise cancelling.Would I recommend.","Unless someone understand the bugs still in them I would not recommendPros* noise cancelling is awesome* the mic quality is exceptional.Cons* Very buggy on the movement around standing sitting, removing headphones and stopping* Newer firmware has partially address some problems but its still not perfect and needs more refinement.","It's not perfect, but it is the best noise cancelling I've yet experienced.","Pricey but incredible sound, great noise cancellation and comfortable to wear.Only drawback is they don’t fold down like the previous Sony headphone models.","Hands down Sony blows Bose away in all categories - noise cancellation, music quality (with a great app to adjust settings for t ypes of music, my music is spiritual and has a wide range from instrumental to vocals, and lastly I love the adaptive noise cancellation feature on these headphones.","However, the bass is really good and doesn't muddle the rest of the music.The noise cancellation is incredible.","There is a HUGE change in what you hear with and without the noise cancellation.","But the sound quality and noise cancellation is perfect for my school trips so I’ll be keeping them.","Noise cancellation is superb!!","The noise cancellation was not great it wasn’t that noticeable, and the ear cups didn’t have any cushioning to it so it wasn’t that comfortable.","The noise cancellation isn't great if you wear glasses (the gap opened by the glasses basically removes the noise cancellation).2.","I can wear them for hours without discomfort, the noise cancellation is not perfect, but it's better than these Sony XM5s, and the design is so much easier to manage and travel with.","The only few noticeable upgrades would be the noise cancellation and the new design.","These are the best headphones on the market the  noise cancelling and sound is amazing.","To test the noise cancellation I turned the sound on about 1/3 volume and my dad spoke to me and I could not hear him.","The noise cancelling is way too good.","Not sure if it was just the one I got but the noise cancellation was no where to be found.","I thought by buying 400 USD headphones I would be blown away.Noise cancelling is nice, but, audio is as good as my 40 and 80 USD headphones from SoundCore and TaoTronics.Noise cancelling might be a little better, but definitely not worth spending 5-10 times what I had with my other headphones.I travel a lot so I thought, I'll pay a premium price to ensure I minimize any outside noise when on a plane or a bus, but it has come with a lot of problems.It pairs with my Win 10 computer, but, audio dissapears every now and then and I have to connect and disconnect.Would definitely return the product if I could, I'm overseas and these are headphones are trouble makers.","The XM5’s (even with adaptive sound control off), seems to toggle the noise cancelation up and down in different environments instead of just keeping the noise cancellation at high.","The headphones are so amazing, but there's a \"feature\" called auto noise cancellation optimization that will completely randomly change the level of noise cancellation on the headphones, making the noise cancellation completely useless at times.","The second thing is that if you use them with speed outside (running, really windy out, or a bus/car window is open) then the wind will fill up the noise cancelling sensors and cause some pretty loud and odd sounds.","Why can’t I just crank the noise cancelling all the way up myself?","My much much older 1000xm2 headphones seem to have stronger noise cancelling.","entirely disappointed in overall sound quality and the features stop at noise cancellation.","Best noise cancelling headphones you can get.","I was wondering if they were loud enough for me in the gym… but they are loud enough to blast over subwoofer strength music AND completely drown it out with noise cancelling technology.","Great product with best noise cancellation","The noise cancellation is excellent and the sound quality especially when u listen to music it is totally worth buying.","I never had noise cancelling headphones and i was stunned when i experienced that feature, but when someone is talking to me i can hear them clearly without hearing the machine in background!","The noise cancellation beats the Bowers Wilkins headphones I previously used.","Other than this, the noise cancellation is top notch.","Also, one of its best features is that it detects your movement and adjusts your setting accordingly, which we can choose from ambient sound, noise cancelling.","Excellent noise cancellation.","Great noise cancellation, sound and comfort, better than XM4.","I would have gotten a deal if the headset actually appeared to look \"new\" according to Amazon's description.The ear cup padding on the headset was faulty, and the noise cancelling didn't even work, even when I paired the headset to the app.","This continued happening throughout the day.Big issues: The noise cancellation is embarrassing  bad on my unit.","Unfortunately I think my unit is either defective or the software is broken considering the very inconsistent performance among users and my pair’s almost complete lack of any active noise cancellation.If possible I would like to speak to someone about this and get my issue resolved because I so badly want to daily drive these headphones.","Noise Cancellation is average.","Noise cancellation is good.","Couldn't believe how good the noise cancelling is!!","You can just put these on your head and just have the NC on to get in your bubble.Pros:Really beautifulInsane noise cancellingGood touch controlEasy pairing and you can pair with 2 devices.","Sound quality is great and the noise cancelling is some of the best I’ve tried.","I can study so much better with these by turning on noise cancelling.","ANC isn't consistent either, it would often feel like the amount of noise cancelled is changing.","Had to switch to this model because XM3 is becoming very hard to findI don't understand the glowing reviewsIt's a step down on the WH-1000XM3 in possibly every way except battery life, which was already long enough to begin withThe padding is much less comfortableBass was apparently balanced and boosted by someone who's deaf to lower frequenciesSize adjustment is needlessly fashionable yet unpracticalMuch more sensible to internal sound from your mouth, or the jack cable touching anythingThe right earphone touchpad sensitivity is ridiculously high, to the point it activates on its own at randomBut worse than all this, while my XM3 models died from the right earphone basically frying out in noise cancelling mode, and what do you know, the XM5 already has right earphone issues barely 1 week after purchase, as opposed to 2 yearsRandom crackling, \"underwater\" audio, issues which can only be fixed by... slapping the earphoneNeedless to say it's not going to last long at this rateAt that price mark this is practically a bad joke and a scam","Great noise cancellation and great sound.","Deep bass even at low volumes.Top notch noise cancelling; I can’t even hear my young children fighting with each other while we are in the same room.Worth every penny if you are a dad like me in need of a little peace and quiet time to yourself for an hour or so on the weekend.","Casual listening…jazz, classical, rock…The best quality sound with noise cancelling.","The a massive difference between noise cancelling and normal mode.","The noise cancellation is just superb - way ahead of the Bose I just replaced with these.","Great noise cancellation and sound(once you use the equalizer).","Noise cancellation is excellent.","The noise cancellation is amazing!!","Neither there is an option to use the usb c, since it’s only charging but is not usable while doing soNoise cancelling “adaptive” is unreliable, let me adjust it manually, what the hell happened sony?","It also has a long range.5) Long battery life and charges fast.6) App features/options - Several options for customizing EQ settings, noise cancellation, transparency, and so on.7) Multiple device connectivity8) I adore the color Sand (white).9) Sound Quality.","I wear my headphones every day for at least five hours a day, so they're a worthy investment in my book because the noise cancellation improves my quality of life (apartment living, etc.","The noise cancellation is definitely better on these than the X4.","Best sounding headphones I have ever bought and the noise cancelling is really nice!","returned as noise cancellation is broken","Best in industry noise cancellation.","But people got to be a little more realistic about the noise cancelling.","The sound quality is good and noise cancellation is excellent .","The noise cancellation is phenomenal.","Great headphones with outstanding noise cancellation!","Pros:Great noise cancellation.Great microphone quality.Cons:The sound signature tries to be a jack of all trades but master of none.","The noise cancellation is so good that I forget about my surroundings.","I can't speak to the noise cancelling or the sound because the discomfort of these headphones overshadows all of that.","The noise cancellation works extremely well and the sound quality is incredible.","The sound is amazing and the noise cancelling is better than the QC35s.","I’ve had them not even 20 minutes and the sound quality/noise cancellation has improved drastically.","Your experience is much more likely to mirror those than the negative reviews.Amazing noise cancellation, great sound quality, and comfortable enough to wear for hours at a time.","Quite an upgrade from the xm4sBetter sound and noise cancelling but the new case sucks.","Noise cancelling is the best I've ever tried.","I’ve been rocking AirPod Pro’s and decided to jump into the new XM-5’s -largely because of Flossy Carter’s rare “quad major go”, but after three days with them, I have to said that the noise cancelling isn’t nearly as good as the Air Pods.","I have The noise cancelling on max setting, good ear cup seal, and I hear running water and people talking quietly next to me.","Noise cancellation and sound quality and EP as advertised!","I also have \"silver\" hair so the white blended in nicely.My only beef with these is the adaptive noise cancelling.","Then, for no reason at all, the noise cancelling cut out and I heard all of the ambient noise.","After about a minute the noise cancelling turned on again.","TL;DR: *ALMOST* plug and play, noise cancelling second to none, amazing sound quality.These are the first expensive headphones I have ever purchased, and I must say, never have I experienced music like this before.","Only when it is paired with it's noise cancelling feature do you stop and listen to things that weren't there before.","The noise cancelling feature can take a little to get used to (couldn't last more than 5 minutes without any music and NC on) but it is well worth it.","All in all, if you're looking for some quality headphone that will get you through that midnight flight, look no further.The only negative note that I could find is that initial setup may be a little bit tedious to get it just the way you want it (Account, Assitant, Noise Cancelling, Ambient Sound, linking music provider, Adaptive  control?, and a bunch of other stuff).I know there are audiophiles out there who will tell you to get \"X\" brand because they're so much better or so much cheaper.","The sound quality and noise cancelling are very good and, if you don't have big ears, they're very comfortable.","Noise cancellation is fantastic!","Waiting on the tarmac or at the gate the noise cancellation worked flawlessly.","I use noise cancelling headphones to make my plane time more peaceful and enjoyable.","I will say right up front, I just couldn't hear any difference in the noise cancelling from my M4's.","PERIOD!Excellent work, Sony!ps my previous headset - Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700","When I first got these I looooved them, sound quality is amazing on these and I love the touch controls as well as the noise cancellation.","There is nothing  I found in their Android app to fix this problem.The headband in narrower than the XM3/4 and therefore more uncomfortable.For the price, seriously Sony, you couldn't add a bigger battery and/or wireless charging?The XM5 anc (noise cancelling) wasn't that much better and it was actually a little worse than the XM3/4 when it came to the dreaded landscaper's two-stroke buzz buzz test....Definitely not worth $400, and not even $350 if you already have an XM4.","I needed headphones with the following features:- Noise cancelling: extraordinary on these headphones- Mic that is usable for Zoom/phone calls: the mics on these headphones are perfect, at last, and I've tried out every other set for sale including the Sony predecessors, whose mics were horrifying- 3.5mm jack: essential for work which requires there to be no audio latency.","2.5mm jacks (Bose, etc) are useless.- Able to be used when battery dead: these headphones can do that!Finally, the perfect noise cancelling over ear headphones!","The noise cancellation is exceptional.","Fit and feel is good.Regarding the noise cancellation, I actually started taking these outside to mow the lawn.","New XM5 compared to XM4+Noise Cancellation+Call Quality+Battery Life+Charging Speed+Ambient Sound (Close to real sound)+Slightly More Comfortable+Many more minor improvements in hardware and softwareYou can reach me at my Insta for any information- imtiyaz.azhar","I have a big head, the XM5 fits more comfortably than the XM4 did, and seems to have better noise cancelling.","However, I will be sticking to wired headphones with good passive noise cancellation.","Grate noise cancellation.2.","Very comfortable feeling.The noise cancelling level is just on and off, there is no manual level adjustment.","I have a pair of $60 noise cancelling headphones that can be registered to any number of devices, so I know it can be done.","I would recommend finding a store that has the various models and trying them out before deciding, as the older models are quite a bit cheaper and might be a better choice if you don’t need the little bit extra noise cancellation you get with these.","Great sound quality and superb noise cancelling.If I have to pick a downside: the p2 cable port doesn't carry microphone audio :(This is the best phone you can by as for Feb, 2023.","Noise cancellation, sound quality are all good, what you'd expect from this series and at this price.","Up until now I’ve just bought cheap Monoprice headphones and the noise cancelling was laughable.This morning my wife walked out and said “Who was at the door?” I said “what do you mean?”She said some guy rang the doorbell a few times and was yelling at our front door.","Didn’t hear a THING.So A+ on the noise cancellation.And I am fine with the touch panel for volume control etc.I’m also a big fan of the speak to chat function.","They are soft and comfortable, great sound quality, and the noise cancellation is unmatched.","Noise cancellation is fantastic.","I bought these for a trip to Japan and I must say the noise cancellation and sound quality are excellent.","After activating noise cancellation all the background noise drops away and you can hear the audio you are listening to very, very well.","No clue what causes this...but I don't think I can recommend these headphones anymore.ORIGINAL REVIEW (**** out of *****):I recently upgraded from the xm4 to the xm5.I had several issues with the previous version (main one being their flawed, slow multipoint BT connection which caused more frustration than the headphones were worth) but some things they implemented on these xm5s are a bit of a head scratcher.PROS:Great sound qualityGreat noise cancellingGreat fit/comfortLong battery lifeSlimmer and less bulky than xm4Better, but not great, multipoint Bluetooth connectionDouble click for spotify is awesomeCONS:Multipoint - still has issues and I have to restart either the headphones or the device it's connected toNot compact/No longer collapsable like xm4 - bummer for travelingHeadphone case is ok but much prefer the xm4 caseThe multipoint was so awful on the xm4 I gave up on them out of sheer frustration.","Both the noise cancellation and sound are amazing.","Noise cancelling is still very annoying, I'll hear all the sound around me till it decides to kick in and block some of it.","With no way to adjust the amount of Noise Cancellation happening, the M3's I've been using has better blocking on some occasions.","The noise cancelling worked just fine.","Great noise cancellation and love being able to use the touch/tap features.","Noise cancellation is top tier no doubt about it when I'm commuting in the city or on a train.","Between the simply noise isolation of the headphones then the active noise cancelling there is very little outside noise audible when I'm listening to music on these headphones.","Doing activities such as school work with the active noise cancelling helped me get so much work done with little to no distractions.","Other than that the noise cancelling and the easy access control are all nice","The sound quality on them is very good for bluetooth noise cancelling headphones and the Sony app offers a good amount of customization of the learning experience.","The XM5s are also hotter and less comfortable to wear over long periods of time.My other problem with them is that the noise cancelling is a bit too smart with the automation.","The noise cancellation is top tier and the sound quality is amazing but there are some really terrible flaws.","Sound, noise cancellation, ergonomics, touch interface (on the headphones), Android app, carrying case are each great on their own.","If your device doesn't support LDAC at 660 or 990Kbps and you're not planning to upgrade soon, then you may be just as happy with Bose QC35 ii and save yourself a few hundred bucks.Along the same lines, if you don't need active noise cancellation, you may be just as happy with something like VModa Crossfade 2 and have quite a few extra buckaroos left over.Minor gripe: matte black finish tends to show some fingerprints, but they're generally easy to clean off.","The former has excellent noise cancellation and the latter is the all-round pair with my favourite sound without noise cancellation.Noise cancellation seems on par or slightly better than Bose QC35, which is saying a LOT.","This noise cancellation also does miracles on aircraft.","You can definitely save some money if you're willing to compromise in the area of noise cancellation or sound but I also think it's pretty easy to justify these Sony's if you have long commutes on public transit and especially if you have long flights.","This particular headphone requires no introduction so I'll get right to it; noise cancellation is pretty good but far from perfect but it is significantly improved in comparison to XM4, overall comfort for me is lacking in comparison to XM4, touch control and other features are noticeably better for me particularly the touch control accuracy.","It supports SBC/AAC/LDAC audio codecs.≡ Noise cancellationNoise cancellation works fairly well for the most part and it ain't noticeably better than XM4 for me personally and it heavily depends on the source of the ambient sounds, particularly the frequencies and I feel that its adaptive/auto noise cancellation does NOT work as well as I want it to be in a particularly chatty environment.","In any event, its noise cancellation capability is amongst one of the best but it's unlikely to work in at all times for everyone (or even most people) because sound perception is highly personal.≡ FeaturesFeature-wise, it's got a similar set of features as XM4 but with minor improvements.","I wasn't extremely excited about the performance at the beginning, but after I took some time to adjust the settings, I am blown away by its outstanding sound clarity, noise cancellation, and smart functionality, so be sure to play around with the settings to find what suits you the best.","The app has multiple features and options to customize and change the EQ settings, the noise cancellation/ambient noise and a feature that I find really interesting: adaptive sound control, which automatically changes between noise cancelling and ambient noise setting depending on where you are/what are you doing.","The faux leather does get a little greasy from your hands & ears but a moist towel usually will do the trick!I think the standout feature of the XM5s are the ANC and noise cancelling.","The noise cancelling doesn't have the weird buzzing or hum that I have noticed other people sometimes complain about with other headphones.","The noise cancelling however is top tier and completely nullifies most noise which is amazing when doing work.In conclusion, these headphones were a league above earbuds in terms of sound quality, comfortability, ANC and NC.","There are multiple presets, but I set mine as a custom to fit my taste.The noise cancellation is incredible.","I like the auto sensing feature where it turns on the hear-through when I'm moving and as soon as I stop/sit down it turns on the noise cancellation.","By no means am I a connoisseur of all things headphones, but you don’t need to be an expert to recognize that this is an excellent pair.The noise cancellation feature is flawless, which is the most important part in my opinion.","They’re perfect for sitting at your desk all day, but if you want to take these while travelling or even on your daily commute to work, they aren’t as conveniently portable as they would be if they folded.Overall, this is a very high-quality pair of headphones that provide excellent noise cancellation, both when listening to audio as well as when using the microphone for a call.","Love the simple hand controls on the right ear piece, swipe to change song, volume control, mute sound, etc...  great noise cancellation.","The function to pause the music when I speak is great and the voice-focused noise cancellation very useful.","I need silence, I didn't realize that the  microphone is also dealing with the noise cancellation too.","-noise cancellation is wildly good-comfort is incredible with the vegan leather-great sound quality-took a step back from MK4 with no folding design- carrying case, consequently, is bulky and harder to travel with-for $50 less, you're just about as well with purchasing the MK4's but these are great and I would recommend","The auto-noise cancellation optimizer is nice, overall I’ve had less issues with connectivity (i.e.","When comparing to the mx4 the sound is slightly but noticeably better, and same for the noise cancellation.","Sound, noise cancellation, build quality and comfort.","Noise cancelling is good.","These are perfect for what I need and I would recommend this to anyone who are looking for a pair of noise cancelling headphones :)","The audio quality is muddy, if audio is your priority look elsewhere such as Shure.If Shure had better noise cancelling I would much prefer them.I like clear precise audio with a flat response, these have reasonably tight bass, but far from clear.I have tried the soundcore, the bass is wildly uncontrolled, the Sony's are far suppiorior to the soundcore.I use the geadphones in the shop with many loud machines, the noise canlling is adequate.","This has amazing sound and noise cancellation.","Just wish directions were clearer in how to work noise cancellation!","They noise cancelling work so well that I'm now having to flicker lights to get his attention when I need to talk to him- he can't hear a damn thing with them on.","Noise cancellation: +Sound quality: +Volume control: +These headphones are great!","Great Noise Cancelling, Good Sounds Quality.","She loves it and says fantastic sound quality and noise cancellation.","To say I’m satisfied is a bit of an understatement.Noise Cancellation: Absolutely wonderful.","Depending on how much you use Noise Cancellation, the volume of playback, and of course the duration of playback.","I had to buy a longer one just so I wouldn’t have to charge the headset on the floor.Special “Cool” Extra: The free downloadable phone app that enables you to customize features of the headphones (update the firmware, equalizer, Noise Cancellation settings, much more).","Even LDAC cannot transmit lossless audio quality.Overall, if you are after great noise cancellation with audio quality second on your list, these are for you!","Excellent noise cancelling, sound quality, and battery life.","The noise cancellation is far, far better in the M5 version.I miss the voice prompts of the M4.","BOSE's QC45 noise cancellation is better than SONY's, I can still hear the noise of children, but I can't hear it at all when I wear BOSE's QC45, but the sound quality of the headphones is very good.I'll keep it because I need a wired headset.","The audio quality and noise cancellation is insane.","Enhanced even further with noise cancelling on.Comfort: 100% can wear these for hours multiple days in a row with little to no ear pain.Battery: don’t have much to say because the battery lasts for hours and takes almost no time to charge.Case: perfect, well built case you can rely on.CONS:black headphones are hard to keep clean because they’re Matte textured so all oils (including natural skin oils) show up on these like a black marker.Not sure there’s a way to replace the ear cups if they get gross.There’s a little hole between the ear muff and the head band connection point that I am concerned could fill up with gunk over time, not sure these are remotely water proof because of this.Would recommend these headphones, but wait until they are on sale.","My name is Lindsey and my pronouns are she/her.When splurging on headphones this expensive, one expects perfect noise cancellation, however, one doesn’t receive perfect noise cancellation.","My fiancée bought a pair of $60 headphones that have better noise cancellation than these WH-1000XM5 headphones that claim to be state-of-the-art, however, the sound quality of these headphones is unmatched.","I have listened to many different headphones and these headphones are the best on the market at the time of writing this review.They’re also lightweight and easy to carry for travel since they come with a case; the user just has to turn the ear muffs and reduce the band length to fit the headphones in the case.Just because these headphones have great sound and are perfect for travel doesn’t excuse the terrible noise cancellation.","++PROS+++ Paired easily to both my phone and PC (individually)+ Using Tidal as a music service to get high quality audio - sounds awesome+ The fit is comfortable, even for long listening sessions+ Good battery life--CONS--- The noise cancellation is good, but could be better- Setting up the multipoint connection (PC/phone simultaneously) was not as intuitive","Excellent noise cancelling.","I have had no issue of any drop at all.5) Battery/Charging - Long enough and charges quickly6) App features/Options - Multiple options to customize EQ setting, noise cancellation, transparency etc.7) Multiple device connectivity8) Love the Sand (white) color9) Sound Quality - Last but not the least sound quality is amazing.","Noise cancelling and transparency modes are a night and day difference with respect to the 1000XM4s, but both are still excellent pairs of headphones.","Unmatched noise cancellation.","Noise cancellation quality is strong, mic clarity is improved, all of this is quite well known.Several flaws in usability makes the experience a bit deceptive:-You cannot charge while in a call, if battery run out, your out.","As soon as I enable noise cancellation, I get drowned in my music and get detached from my surrounding!","Sound great, just not liking the automatic noise cancelling feature switching itself at random","I love everything about these headphones -- noise cancellation, touch controls, transparency mode and sound quality.","The highly touted industry standard noise cancellation is far inferior to my airpods pro.","Despite the extra processor and microphones in the XM5 I found the noise cancelling inferior to my XM4 - especially for blocking out voices.","If Sony fixes the XM5 software I will certainly purchase the headphones again - but not in its current form.Update: the latest firmware 1.1.3 does improve the noise cancelling a little bit, but it’s still not as good as the previous XM4.","Most automatic/convenience features are nearly unusable.The noise cancelling works well for low pitched sounds, but does virtually nothing for higher pitched sounds, and cannot be adjusted.","When I wear these overpriced earmuffs with the noise canceling activated, as soon as I say a word out loud, the noise cancelling goes poltergeist and shuts everything off.Waste of hard-earned money.","The only thing that stops it is turning the noise cancelling all the way off.As an aside, I bought the Dekoni earpads, which give you about an extra ¼\" of room for your ears and seal a bit better.","Things that have not worked so far include putting the headphones on a heating pad set to about 110°F overnight, wrapping them in said heating pad overnight, using a blow-dryer for 30 minutes (all I could stand w/o noise cancelling).My environment is not hot or particularly humid, I mostly am at 68 to 72° and 40 to 60%RH.I would give 4 stars for sound if not for this issue.They sound ok, but not as good as my big cans or my KZ ZSX & FIIO BTR5.","Noise cancelling has multiple levels which you DO NOT control, will change automatically, very unsettling.","And if you wear glasses the seal for noise cancelling is broken on and off CONSTANTLY.","Not worth the price previous generation sounds better in noise cancellation and volume control.","Noise cancelling is not that effective.2.","Noise cancellation is not able to stop TV voice, clearly I can hear TV noise with anc.4.","I wanted a pair of headphones for my game room but couldn’t find anything pink, noise cancelling and high quality worth the price.","They are so lightweight and have a great amount of noise cancelling.","Unfortunately I got these headphones for active noise cancellation and for inexplicable reasons sony has decided that they are smarter than the consumer and took away the ability to set the anc strength that the xm4s had.","My iPods have better sound without a subscription.As far as noise cancellation, it worked the first time.","I bought these mostly for the noise cancellation features and it hardly does anything for me.","The sound quality and noise cancelling are great, but I just can’t seem to get them loud enough.","The sound quality is pretty good, and noise cancelling is not bad, but Bose 700 does a better job.","Noise cancellation, sound quality, battery life all get a 5/5, the ability to recharge the battery in minutes and last for hours is a force to be reckoned with.","They have excellent noise cancellation, great sound quality and they are super light.","Noise cancellation is poor, doesn't work if you are moving.","Sony has downgraded from xm4.The only 2 good things in this headphones are fast charging and sound quality.Don't buy if you are looking for noise cancellation, comfortablity or upgrade from xm4.","absolutely exceptional noise cancelling.","The noise level at work is very loud and the first time I put these on I was amazed at the level of noise cancelling.","In terms of sound quality, I am not an audiophile but I feel this is the one area where they are at least equal, everything else is a wash.- Noise Cancelling.","I've also noticed this odd feeling when using noise cancelling, almost like a pressure on the inside of my ears.- Ergonomics.","Maybe the padding is too thin.Next, I immediately noticed the noise cancelling was not as good.","The sound is amazing, noise cancelling spot on, but the product manager blew it on one thing.","The noise cancelling is good, but banging pots and pans will still come through somewhat.","they are really heavy, not comfortable at all, The Sony WH-1000XM5, are very comfortable to wear, the battery last a long time, and you can pair them to 2 deceives at the same time which is a really neat feature if you are working in your computer and get a phone call, the sound quality is very impressive, the noise cancellation is good and ambient mode is descent ,  ambient mode is not as good as the airpods max, but considering everything else, I would go with this ones.","Bought noise cancelling headphones for my CPTSD (I’m sensitive to unpredictable sounds and I needed something to help me get through family gatherings for the holidays.)","The allergic reaction is the least concerned I could have for this.The noise cancelling for sure it is moderately improved over xm3 and the microphone results are amazing - It could not pick up my kid's crying right behind me.Too bad I cannot use this - my outer ear is getting red and swollen even after 2 hours of use.","At 6 months the noise cancelling started making a low bass rattling noise.","My \"daily driver\" headphones are in-ear Beats Fit Pro and AirPods Pro; wired Westone W40 (airplanes) - tried their wireless adapter and it's awful; and Bose QC35 ii (which for some reason has started to disconnect from my iPad Pro).Pros- Noise cancelling is absolutely the best for white noise (my AirPods Pro - latest firmware 4E71 - has lost 80% of noise cancellation - see online support/reviews for others' comments on this)- I can play music super low - like 5-15% of total.","Quirky, okay, but there are a lot of controls - and you can see Sony has improved it over the past 2-3 years with more functionality- Speak-to-pause works well (disables noise cancellation and you can talk with others).","Got them late due to neighbors.Review:Noise cancellation(10/10) are amazing the noice cancellation works very well.","But after listening to these new WH-1000XM5 headphones side by side with my XM4's and AirPods Max, I would say that the noise cancellation is slightly better on the XM5.","Noise cancellation improved a lot from predecessor XM4.Punchy base.Can listen long hours without damaging ear.","Excellent headphones with great sound quality and noise cancellation.","Other headphones that I have tried always used to apply constant pressure on my eardrum when noise cancellation was on, but this doesn't, and the noise cancellation is the best I've used to date.","Noise cancellation is best.","They are newer then the wh-1000xm4 yet seemingly don't work as well or at all.I had noise cancelling simply doesnt work.","These are absolutely not worth it when the main feature of noise cancelling just doesn't work.","I love the noise cancellation on these, and the sound is fantastic, or would be.","I purchased the headphones 2 months ago and have been able to use them for maybe 2 weeks total.The noise cancelling is great, bluetooth range is wonderful and the sound quality was originally awesome.","The sound and noise cancellation work great but the design is HORRIBLE compared to the XM4s.You can’t fold them, they smack together when you pick them up like the airpod pros I returned, they adjust with the slightest movement.","The design flaws are not worth the slightly better noise cancellation.Unfortunately I sold my old pair before receiving this new pair so I’m kind of stuck with them.","I took them to work and they were absolute trash in cancelling out louder than library level conversations.I tried out the Bose headset and I can say those headsets have far better noise cancellation but are not as comfortable as the XM5’s.I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT MY BEATS FIT PRO DID THE EXACT SAME JOB… BETTER.","Sprang for these because they were repeatedly rated highly, especially the noise cancellation.","Noise cancellation is not as good as my bose earbuds or apple airpods pro.","I also have a pixel 6 pro and it worked as expected with both.Battery - Same as the xm4 which is great.Noise cancellation - Great and slightly better than the XM4s.Overall I think Sony sacrificed portability which is where I put these headphones purpose.","Sound quality is amazing and the noise cancelling on an airplane is almost unbelievable.","They have good noise cancellation and ambient modes and are comfortable for medium periods of listening.","However,  Apple's AirPods Max has superior Noise cancellation, ambient modes and music reproduction in my experience.","The EAH-A800 are better at noise cancellation & ambient modes  and have great sound reproduction & best of all I can wear them for hours with no discomfort.","A comfortable set of headphones with outstanding noise cancellation and great battery life.","These headphones take that to the next level.Not only is the noise cancellation improved, it's location sensitive.","I find this feature a little gimmicky but it will dynamically figure out what kind of noise cancellation profile to use based on its app and manual overrides from you.","On a 9-hour overseas flight, I use 10% of my battery using the headphones continuously with the noise cancellation enabled.","With the 1/8\" plug, it works well with my gaming laptop with no lag and still having noise cancelling available.","I can't even hear the noisy (~60dB) fans on my computer with these headphones on.Noise cancellation is improved, but I did find it had some issues with (1) eating (where the jaw bone is moving the ear cups) and (2) moving your head side to side (getting some false noise readings where the surface is sound absorbent, like an airplane seat).","They're lighter, more comfortable, and have better noise cancellation.","The noise cancellation is no joke, I love them!","The noise cancellation and sound quality are superior to similar Bose headphones in my opinion.","Functionally, it is on par with the M3 and M4.Sound-wise, it sounds about the same - no complaints.The noise cancellation, however, is not as good as the M3 or M4.","You can be seated on a plane, turn your head, and suddenly the noise cancellation sucks because the headset is sampling the environment because it detecting a noise change when you moved your head.Worse still, I was on a noisy jet seated next to the window.","It checked all the boxes in terms of sound quaility, noise cancellation, and volume control, but it would slide off my head from the littlest of movement.","I do not think the Noise Cancelling on the XM5 is any better than the Bose QC35’S but definitely not worse.","I play PS5 and Switch and I need a jack port.The noise cancelling is GREAT, I hate noisy flights, I tried them first time and they are GOOD, I listened to music and watched Netflix shows and everything was perfect.For calls is great, you can control.everything with your right hand, sometimes the headphones unpaired with my job laptop (windows, I don't know if this is related to the operating system.Audio quality is beyond my expectations, I could hear my favorite and realized there were instruments I never heard.So far I have a great experience with the headphones.","Years ago, I foreswore Sony products because of their poor reliability, ridiculously proprietary nature, and bad service and support.While this product still has stupid proprietary bits (mainly in software), they can be safely ignored, and the device seems to work well with both my Android phone and my Linux computers.The headphones themselves are comfortable, have good battery life, and have much better noise cancellation with enormously more useful features than my old Bose Quiet Comfort 35s.","I was hoping that with all the hype the 1000XM5s would be substantially better than the AirPods Max.The biggest complaint is that when touching the ear cup on the Sonys you can easily hear it, the same action on the AirPod Max is minimal.Both headsets have excellent audio, with the Max edging out the XM5s.Controls -XM5 winsComfort - I prefer the Max but it is more an individual choice.Case - XM5Ease of use - MaxNoise Cancelling - Tie","They sound great but I think the noise cancellation option is better on the xm4.","Noise cancellation of the xm5 is actually outstanding good!BUT2.","Overall regret this purchase relative to bose.Pros:- Look good- Sound quality is OKCons:- Active Noise Cancelling is an absolute joke on these.","I did configure the app, and turned off the adaptive sound control so I ould keep Noise Cancelling always on.","Also unprompted, the noise cancellation would shut off and on.","The quality of sound, noise cancelling and Alexa features out performs the rest.","The noise cancellation is great and they are comfortable for me.","The noise cancelling stays on even if I tap or bump the headset now.","Hopefully a future update will let us leave the noise cancelling maxed like I was able to do with my old XM3 headset!","The noise cancelling is awesome.","Love the sound quality, noise cancellation is comfortable and it doesn’t feel like i’m in a vacuum, battery life is impeccable, mic is great (very good at voice isolation) and honestly they look so cute.","Coming from the AirPod pros the noise cancellation is noticeably bad, didn’t expect it from the supposed noise cancellation kings of headphones.","Couldn’t test noise cancelling or sound because they were enormous.","The noise cancellation was poor - it didn’t block out voices.","I bought them for household noise cancellation for sleeping but they do not cancel household noises.","A huge disappointment,and very poor design choices.How these got out into production is baffling.Absolute worst: the noise cancelling can't be set \"just On\".","The silly \"adaptive\" sound cancellation \"feature\" constantly causes noise cancellation to turn on and off, at roughly 10 second intervals.","Sony, PLEASE FIX THIS and allow it to just stay on full noise cancellation!","Best setting if coming from XM4's is ExcitedThey can be more comfortable and all but NC is way weaker than XM4's in trains and you CAN'T DEACTIVATE the \"Auto NC\".. not on the settings, not Ambient Sound, anywhere... You van set everything to Noise Cancelling but it still changes automatically MESSING UP THE EXPERIENCE.","Excellent build quality.Very good sound.LOUSY NOISE CANCELLATION!I returned them because of that.","Noise cancellation worksWell; sound quality best in class","The previous WH-1000XM4 had 1 Sony QN1 ANC processor with 4 microphones & it did an amazing job at noise cancellation!","XM5s we're marginally more comfortable, but not enough to make a difference to me either.The couple things that were much better was it's ability to auto pause when removing the headphones connect to 2 devices at once (XM3 doesn't have that), the ambient sound mode was so much better, and the headphones overall responsiveness to touch/button controls was much faster.As for noise cancelling, I'm convinced that there is variation in noise cancellation strength between each individual pair of WH-1000XM5 headphones.","So I know that objectively, the XM5s should have better noise cancelling than most competitors, especially the old XM3s.","The most important item to me was the noise cancellation.","The bass was better on the Bose headphones, but the noise cancellation was not there on the Bose.","Noise cancelling and transparency modes are a night and day difference with respect to the 1000XM4s, but both are still excellent pairs of headphones.","The noise cancellation, sound quality and battery life is amazing!","HOWEVER the main issue is, the Noise cancelling from the Microphones is non-existent.","ANC with no noise cancellation on mic is useless.","Amazing fit, very light, battery lasting close to 40 hours, amazing noise cancelling and transparency mode.","The sound quality is amazing and the noise cancellation is fantastic.","Ear buds fall out, leak sound and fail to provide adequate noise cancellation.","Comfort, hours of use, excellent sound, touch features, noise cancellation, no external sound leakage, ease of use.... the list goes on...","And the multi point

features and noise cancelling these cannot be beat!","My headphones were set to about the middle volume setting with noise cancelling turned on and I could not hear any of the airplane noise.","I ordered the Sony WH-1000XM5 after looking at a lot of noise cancellation headphones.","I already had a pair of Pro Ears Pro Mag Gold for hearing protection but wanted these to help focus on projects and be able to get some well needed sleep.These headphones reduce ambient noises very well but still enables me to hear when someone calls my name, even when sleeping.Pros:- Great if you rest or sleep facing forward- Pairs easily with iPhone and/or computers- Lightweight and comfortable- Easily adjust the head strap- Great if you need to block out room noises and focus on a projectCons:- Bulky and uncomfortable if you’re a side sleeper- Needs an introductory video on how to use the tapping features (pause noise cancellation to speak/listen to others)-There are multiple tapping features available for the headphones but I haven’t found any tutorials on how to make the best of themSummary:The Sony WH-1000XM5 noise cancelling headphones work great if you want them to focus on a project, listen to music or watch a movie however; if you’re a side sleeper and want these to help you block out noises so you can sleep I found these too bulky and they kept coming off.","I ordered these and a pair of Oro Sound Tild Pro headset and these outperformed the tild pro which had an actual boom mic and has amazing reviews for noise cancellation in the microphone.","I bought these because I had a gift card to spend and I wanted to get a full-size set of cans wit great noise cancelling (better than my airpod pro’s).","Noise cancelling took me by surprise.","This feature is very bad and makes the noise canceling quite weak and fluctuating often.Side by side comparison with the Xm4 and Xm3 shows that the noise cancellation is clearly worse!","The sound quality is better though, but for the price you’d expect the noise cancellation to be better than years old models.","The sound quality, the noise cancellation, the design and quality is just not up to par with the price that’s being

on the release date, I could use the noise cancelling option for hours however, after over a year, I can no longer handle noise cancellation beyond 15 minutes it gives me severe ear pain and I must switch to transparency mode or take them off and break.The XM5’s on the other hand, do not cause me any pain, regardless of if I’m listening for 30 minutes or 2 hours.","During testing, I listened to music for a long period of time and watched a YouTube for an hour.I feel that prolonged listening to the APM using the noise cancelling feature caused my ears to become highly sensitive after using them for over a year, with a feeling of severe cabin pressure.","Also, the noise cancelling feature from the XM5’s don’t give me the ‘cabin pressure’ feeling found from the APM.","I'm sure there are better options but that's what I used.For the ANC (noise cancelling), XM3's were much better in 'my' experience.","If you use spectacles, you won't feel comfortable with these, even if you wear it

cancelling is greatI have PTSD and random system sounds really hurt me.","Battery life is amazing, but that is to be expected from any premium wireless over your headphones.The touch controls have a bit of a learning curve, but they are for the most part very good (I have one issue with them, but I will get to that later).The noise cancelling is amazing of course, but what is more impressive is the improvements made to transparency mode.","The Sony headphone is the best for both noise cancelling functionality as well as intuitive controls.","It allows you to carry on conversations by pausing

quality and battery life are amazing too.","It feels to me that Mark 4’s lost so much of details in the sound quality, when you listen to this.ANC: Noise cancellation has been improved by a lot.They still cannot cancel noise to a 100%, but well, no headphones can do it yet, but it is the best of any headphone out there.","I really like the accompanying app that allows you to adjust EQ and indicates what noise cancellation mode it is in along with how much battery life is left.","While I was completely impressed with the superior noise cancelling, the terrible battery life and impossible audio controls (when connected to two devices), made me ship them back.","The Sennheiser noise cancelling and audio quality were fabulous.","4 hours in, the noise cancelling is on par with

wear.3) Function - It has all the functions I loved with my old headphones with more sensitive and touch-friendly material on the  headphones which acts as a remote (forward, backward volume up /down/ pause/play, etc.","The new case is of quality, light material and has a loop to carry it with.","Best pair of ANC headphones I've ever used overall in terms of sound quality, materials used, weight on head and styling.","I don't know why Sony chose this new earpad material but it's not very good and should to be revised in the next version.","They feel cheaper than the XM4 but Sony did use cheaper material.","They are a bit bigger and the frame does feel a little more plasticky — the premium-feeling materials are a big area where they lose out to Apple's higher quality of touch and feel.","It's also made out of that weird plasticy material that shows fingerprints VERY easily and makes it look like it's dirty.","Materials are really cheap for the price you pay, plastic can’t even stand a 1.5 meter fall.","I did not like them at all, their noise cancellation is not good, what is that the material of the headphones is of very good quality but I do not like it","The noise cancelling is excellent as always, definitely helped out by the better seal of the new pad material, and transparency mode is better, albeit not as good as the Airpods Max.Cons: While I enjoy and understand the use-case for noise-cancelling audio tech, there are several choices about the XM5 that I have to question about Sony.","Es un buen producto pero deberían comprarlo cuando esté en descuento son ligeros tienen un sonido increíble.El único punto negativo es que después de unas horas te hace sudar las orejas por los materiales de las almohadillas nada recomendable si hace mucho calor en tu localidad.","Los materiales son de plástico, pero la calidad de la cancelación de ruido es suprema","The case seems to be made of eco-friendly material and a big fan of the design.Only complaint is the gold logos on the black headphone seems retro-styling wise.","Somehow, this material on the outer side of the overhead piece, is starting to peel off.","Me gustó el diseño, la autonomía y la

la sensación de calidad y apariencia, aunque entiendo que se usa este plástico para mantener ligeresa y comodidad.","App UI could be done in better way like Google's Material UI.","It seems that Sony is using cheaper and cheaper materials every year with each addition of new headphones.Unfortunately, this trend has come full circle with these new XM5 headphones.","This could be resolved with different material of cushions, but unfortunately the cushions can’t be replaced/exchanged, overall build quality reminds me of 30$ headphones.There is absolutely no mute functionality, it’s wireless and has Bluetooth, why do I need to mute on my device?","PROS1) The market's best ANC.12 Quick installation3) Comfortable - The earcups are softly padded and made of a high-quality faux leather material.4) Connectivity- It connects quickly and seamlessly.","PS> The pads are fine they are designed to be really soft, the only way anyone can say its not enough is if they have had them at least 1 year, or they have failed with-in short period of time I have not seen that anywhere & the material is clearly something ultra modern as well because its not the same as my other 3 HF's.","Build

la cancelación de ruido podría ser mejor pero aún así es muy buena.","Me gustaron mucho los materiales se sienten de una mayor calidad qué el modelo anterior pero estos audífonos en particular no son

más pequeñas y al girar la cabeza o cualquier movimiento se pierde la cancelación de ruido por que se desacoplan de las orejas no les recomiendo este modelo lo tuve que devolver por que no me gusto que quitaron mucha flexibilidad estos audífonos es para estar en un lugar quieto como en el hogar o una oficina por que para el transporte público o andar caminando en la calle o lugares con muchas personas no lo recomiendo prefiero ampliamente el modelo anterior es más cómodo para la mayoría de las situaciones cotidianas y estos son más pesados y tozcos","Great sound quality, solid materials,

Premium- Made from Recycled MaterialsCons- Treble is too Sharp and hurts my ears with \"clapping\" sfx's- Uncomfortable- Slips off of the Head too Easily- ANC is good, but not as good as what I expected- Oil from Head shows on these very EasilyOther- Controls can be a bit annoying, but I think they can be adjusted in the App","The overall build quality was great with the use of some high-quality plastic(or some other nice and light material) The new design didn't seem to impact functionality although it might help with the duration of the headphones by removing the hinges.","Battery was pre-charged to about 65%3) Comfortable - The earcup are soft padded with a faux leather type material that appears to be of good quality.","Also the sound profile of the previous generation WH-1000XM4s can be easily restored by using the \"excited\" EQ setting in the companion app settings.Those carbon fiber dual drivers, 8 noise canceling mics and custom audio co-processor Sony keeps referring to in the marketing materials, are genuinely significant.","My only criticism is the case they come in is made of a material and I don’t like the feel of it…but he headphones I cannot fault if I try.","Am not blown away by the sound quality but after tuning the equaliser settings, I am happy with it.ANC is top notch, it’s definitely best in that category, maybe beating even AirPods Max.Quality of materials used is right for its price, can’t expect more but the cushioning is just great!","They say the new carbon-fiber material and tinkering with the tuning makes it sound better.","Perhaps, but why didn't they just use the new material AND keep the 40mm drivers, as a larger driver will normally yield stronger sound, though some may say it's not necessary.","Also the material of the pads is soft but collapses more, making you feel the tightness on the side of your head.","However, this much lighter design thanks to the materials chosen results in supreme comfort whereas the AirPods Max shows its weight after an hour or two on my head.","I think it's once again because of the material.","The sound quality was great but the material feels cheap.","I'm passionate about good speakers and audio equipment which allow for musical yet truthful portrayals of the source material.","The question is, does the AirPods Max provide enough value to justify its higher price?-- Materials and Design: This is a subjective comparison, but the AirPods Max has the better build and design in my estimation.","Despite the lightweight the materials are actually pretty nice.","Sony WH-1000XM5 is an awesome product in this category with great ANC, sound quality and extreme comfort wearing them.Looks are very premium, even to the touch of materials and

just like a normal set of headphones.One of the problems I have always found with over ear headphones was with the ear cups sticking to my skin over a long period of wearing them, or just feel greasy from skin oil after awhile.So after a number of cleanings, the leather, or whatever material it is, possibly vinyl, would potentially start to peel.","Those carbon fiber dual drivers, 8 noise canceling mics and custom audio co-processor Sony keeps referring to in the marketing materials, are genuinely significant.","But although the headphones are made of recycled materials it still has a slightly more premium build quality than some but is nowhere the build quality of some others like the Bang & Olufsen Beoplay H95’s.","But they are unbelievably light weight so that is a good reason to go with those materials.","Lo único malo (al menos con la opción en negro) es el material, ya qué al tener acabado matte no es muy limpio, se quedan manchas con el uso y se tienen que limpiar constantemente","The headphones work great, but the quality of the materials must not be very good.","It turns out there's almost no material connecting the earcup and holding it in place.","I'm not sure why such expensive headphones have such cheap materials.","And unfortunately I cannot find a way to re-connect the pieces, there's not enough material to glue together without blocking the earcup from rotating.","They're lightweight, comfortable and I love the material!The sound is great: crisp, smooth and pops!I love the smart features of them pausing and playing depending on whether they're on or off your head.","The build material feels a little cheap for the price compared to the Apple cans but are super light weight and comfortable.","Neither are they as portable due to fix sides, but the plastic material feels cheap, and the overall design makes them really difficult to wear when doing anything but sitting still, as they often shift or even fall off entirely, which was not a problem whatsoever with the XM4s!Overall, the sound is still great, but this is not what a \"new\" generation of an electronic device should be.","Sound quality is fantastic  but my the padding is not

40mm drivers.The sound on these BT headphones is good, and the battery technology is great.","The smaller mm drivers react to lower powered cellphones quite well and the battery lasts a nice amount of hours.","Battery life can get him through the day.","The battery life is GREAT.","Battery life is similar to other models.","Seriously Sony who thought of the no folding design?While they're very light and comfy, have great noise cancelling for certain frequencies, contain amazing call quality, have 30-40 hrs of battery and the touch sensors on the right ear cup are SUPER fun and easy to use, I would not buy these if you're also expecting great sound.","Because of this reason, battery will also drain a lot.9.","if you use provided wire (generally when battery is low), mic does not work on it.","They are comfortable to wear.Battery like is mediocre.","I had a cheaper set of Sony headphones that had much better battery life.The deal breaker is that they drop the bluetooth connection at least every 20 minutes, sometimes every few minutes.","Having a long battery life, and auto shut off when you take them off are features I wouldn't want to live without now.","They aren't helping you out if the battery is dead.","Battery life is also good, I've been using it for 1 week for casual times and it didn't even tell me to charge it.Overall, This is such a friendly headphone, I am recommending it to anyone who wants a headphones that has (good design, quality, durability, friendly, and comfortable).","PROS:Fantastic ANC (utilizes 8 microphones)Paired much easier and quicker than any other BT headphones I’ve triedLouder volume than any other BT headphones I’ve triedOutstanding sound qualityGreat control and features within the AppVery responsive and intuitive touch controls - I raised the volume by correctly guessing to swipe up on the right ear cup.Love the case with a magnetic closure inside that stores charge cable etc.Very happy that they have included the option to use as wired headphonesAmazing battery life (up to 30 hours) with quick charge options (3 minute charge with a USB-PD compatible charger gives 3 hours of use)Can be paired with 2 bluetooth devices at the same timeGood adjustments can be made for a comfortable fitVery lightweight for their sizeCONS:My ears were sweating a bit after prolonged use…could be more comfortable","This headset is really great worth buying because the music comes out like magic Isolation is very cool and comfortable Do not be alarmed  The thing that amazed me is the battery, the sound and the insulation well.","The battery lasts for a very long time.","The battery is amazing as well.","Perfect battery life and charges right up faster than you can imagine.","Battery life is also excellent.","(i suspect it is forced this way to get that extra long battery life)(i'd rather have shorter battery life than having weak NC)I have used the XM4 for 2 years.","honestly the best sony headphones i’ve used, everything is just right and battery life is amazing.","Very effective, perfect noise cancellation, great sound quality and battery lasts forever.","I use these headphones both on Bluetooth to my phone and wired at my desk plugged into an analog music source.I use the ANC in all use cases, and it's really good for mitigating distractions.I have avoided the smartphone app and higher-level configurations as for now I just need headphones to be headphones.Wired Analog; ANC is optional when wired, and a full charge lasts for 20-24 hours of constant play.Wired USB; works well, and of course charges at the same timeBlueTooth; Of course not as rich as an analog source, but still sounds great, and when using as a 2-way headset I'm quite impressed at the sound quality and noise-rejection on both ends.Callers on the other end of a BT call report very solid sound quality on my voice.Runtime per charge is reduced somewhat while on BT, I'd guess something like 10-12 hoursComfort;Spring compression is about right to balance between comfort and sealing.It would be nice if the pad stuffing was a bit more resilient, as on the head the pads compress until my ears are in contact with the speaker grid and that can get uncomfortable after an hour or so.CONS;The ANC does not time out when there's no signal, which has left me several times with a dead battery when I've been interrupted, taken them off and forgotten to power down the headphones.One other \"feature\" that i don't really care for is that speaking aloud while ANC is on cancels the ANC and mutes the source until you manually flip it back on again.","Noise cancelling is better than the XM$ at eliminating sound I used to get on the XM4 You'll get the same battery life as the XM4 also.","Really like that the batteries hold a charge for a lot longer that l thought they would.","Their battery life too...","That’s very, very annoying.Those are my primary gripes.The battery life is amazing, the comfort is okay, the new design seems better (my old ones are held together by electrical tape at the hinges).I will be giving these one more week trial, I hope that some software update remedies the issue 🤞","Battery life appeared to be very good again.","First let’s start of by saying I’m seeing so many positive reviews by people who never owned the xm4 or previous models they sound like promo reviews by SONY if you ask me, so you can understand the frustration by people who have owned previous models, first let’s start with noise cancellation which is awful on the xm5 no manual adjustments to the noise cancellation, and the auto noise cancellation optimization is a zonk on this generation Sony you took something so simple and nice and just messed it up, taking phone calls with these headphones were great and battery life is always awesome with the XM LINEUP,  now let’s start with the clamping force on this one I find myself having to lift the headphones off of my head because the feeling is so tight never had an issue with the XM4, the build quality on this one feels okay and the touch controls are much faster and responsive on this generation, the ability to not fold on this generation is a zonk to me as well but it looks like Sony is going in this direction so this would have some getting used to as they are following the other competitors with their designs as well, sound quality is great not excellent as everyone has their own methods and ideas as to what good sounding headphones are, until the noise cancellation is fixed, clamping force and more comfortable pads I don’t see the reason to try to like these headphones because they are the newest thing out, these manufacturers are putting out junk and not ready products at the cost of my wallet","Battery life is great.","Great battery life.","Battery life is great and charging time is impressive (40 minutes according to my measures).","Comfort is top notch and the battery life is amazing.","The battery life is amazing !","After first charge on this headset I used it 5 days straight (between 4-8 hours a day) and have just hit 10% battery on day 5.","They are not much of a step up from the XM4s.And... also note that according to Sony: \"We are sorry, but the battery is not replaceable on the WH1000XM5 headphones.\"","They are super comfortable with or without glasses, sound amazing and battery life is superb.","Sound quality is fantastic as well, i enjoy quality sound, own a pair of Beyerdynamic 770dt 80ohm and these Sonies  are just as enjoyable to listen, maybe lag behind the Beyers with quality of sounds, but still sound incredible and I don't have to carry a portable amp to listen to them lolbattery life is another feature that I'm amazed with, listened all day and didn't discharge, i cant say i listened for 30 hours without charge yet, simply because i don't want to run out of battery while I'm listening to an audiobook in an industrial facility, but 10 hours at a time they lasted no problem.","It is fine, in every aspect, the sound quality and battery life is just a step ahead from its previously generation.The fit and the comfort though, is just bad for me personally, I struggle to wear this continuously for more than an hour, that’s where it’s really disappointing.","The battery life seems to live up to its claims.","I charged the headphones to 100% and after 6 hours of straight use, the battery life is at 80%.","I own the 1000XM3 and a bose qc35 and this one's battery life is really impressive compared to them.","This review was written on May 31, 2022PROS:The sound quality and battery life are absolutely amazing.","The battery lasts a long time.","Great battery life and audio quality.","Had to switch to this model because XM3 is becoming very hard to findI don't understand the glowing reviewsIt's a step down on the WH-1000XM3 in possibly every way except battery life, which was already long enough to begin withThe padding is much less comfortableBass was apparently balanced and boosted by someone who's deaf to lower frequenciesSize adjustment is needlessly fashionable yet unpracticalMuch more sensible to internal sound from your mouth, or the jack cable touching anythingThe right earphone touchpad sensitivity is ridiculously high, to the point it activates on its own at randomBut worse than all this, while my XM3 models died from the right earphone basically frying out in noise cancelling mode, and what do you know, the XM5 already has right earphone issues barely 1 week after purchase, as opposed to 2 yearsRandom crackling, \"underwater\" audio, issues which can only be fixed by... slapping the earphoneNeedless to say it's not going to last long at this rateAt that price mark this is practically a bad joke and a scam","For me the standout feature is it's battery life, It's been a week now and battery is still at 16 % without single charge, overall I guess it last between 23-26 hours with ANC.Sound quality is good when you use custom equalizer setting but It's not outstanding, may be I was expecting magic out of it.","Last but not the least, it gives you 30 hours of battery backup (with ANC on) on a single charge & gives 3 hours of backup with just 3 mins of charge.","It provide decent battery life and support fast charging.","No problemo!Battery, I had to charge this headphone only once.","They are incredibly comfortable, have crystal clear sound, and solid battery life.","Battery life has been awesome so far too, definitely plenty for my use.To sum up, there haven't been any major issues that I've encountered while using these.","This si my opinion after one month of use and i am very disappointed.Pro - Good Noice Cancelling- charing battery fastCon - Head band very, very unconfortable after 1h of use- No folding, the new case is much bigger.l- No NFC for connecting with phone- Sound not a big difference from XM2- designSomehow i like the new XM5 but is not better than the XM2 which is much older.First of all the confort, is terrible, the head band is very narrow and and not so soft like the XM2 and i believe XM3 and XM4 are the same.In matter of sound quality you have to listen very carefull to notice a difference, if you think are 3 generation apart you expect something better.You can't fold them, the new case take so much space.On the XM2 i had NFC and i just touched the phone to the headphones and the connection was super fast, super effective.Not anymore with XM5.My personal opinion if you have Sony XM4 or below the XM5 is just a waste of money.","It also has a long range.5) Long battery life and charges fast.6) App features/options - Several options for customizing EQ settings, noise cancellation, transparency, and so on.7) Multiple device connectivity8) I adore the color Sand (white).9) Sound Quality.","It's high quality, with amazing sound quality, is easy to use, is customizable, has many features, and a long battery life.","(was disappointed :( )these headphones shut off randomly when using them, the app has been wildly problematic, settings are constantly reset, the battery doesn’t last as long.","And battery life last so long and I used them daily.","Very good all day use battery life and fast charged.","The battery life has been very good-I get about 30 hours and the touch controls are solid.","No, don’t want to hassle and I do like them, but if you’re looking to buy, I’d wait for a sale or go with a lower model and if you are okay with 6 hour battery life, go with AirPod Pros or for $400, get two pairs of AirPod pros.","Build quality, material, battery life, charge time are all exceptional.","The battery also seems to be very good.","There is nothing  I found in their Android app to fix this problem.The headband in narrower than the XM3/4 and therefore more uncomfortable.For the price, seriously Sony, you couldn't add a bigger battery and/or wireless charging?The XM5 anc (noise cancelling) wasn't that much better and it was actually a little worse than the XM3/4 when it came to the dreaded landscaper's two-stroke buzz buzz test....Definitely not worth $400, and not even $350 if you already have an XM4.","2.5mm jacks (Bose, etc) are useless.- Able to be used when battery dead: these headphones can do that!Finally, the perfect noise cancelling over ear headphones!","New XM5 compared to XM4+Noise Cancellation+Call Quality+Battery Life+Charging Speed+Ambient Sound (Close to real sound)+Slightly More Comfortable+Many more minor improvements in hardware and softwareYou can reach me at my Insta for any information- imtiyaz.azhar","Given that these are $500.00 headphones and that the battery will eventually die.The battery should be user replaceable.","Battery is good.","No clue what causes this...but I don't think I can recommend these headphones anymore.ORIGINAL REVIEW (**** out of *****):I recently upgraded from the xm4 to the xm5.I had several issues with the previous version (main one being their flawed, slow multipoint BT connection which caused more frustration than the headphones were worth) but some things they implemented on these xm5s are a bit of a head scratcher.PROS:Great sound qualityGreat noise cancellingGreat fit/comfortLong battery lifeSlimmer and less bulky than xm4Better, but not great, multipoint Bluetooth connectionDouble click for spotify is awesomeCONS:Multipoint - still has issues and I have to restart either the headphones or the device it's connected toNot compact/No longer collapsable like xm4 - bummer for travelingHeadphone case is ok but much prefer the xm4 caseThe multipoint was so awful on the xm4 I gave up on them out of sheer frustration.","As well as if your Bluetooth connection to your iPhone the iPhone will display his battery level as well.","**Edit after a month of use:Using Multi-device connection is very spotty, 3 out of 10 times the headphones will completely turn off without warning, even with a full battery.","These headphones have been much better than I was expecting and everything is as advertised, especially the battery life, I wear it all day at work everyday with NC on and charge it maybe twice a week at most.","I have to adjust the head phones to sit at a slightly different angle every few minutes.Battery life is excellent.","I haven't used them long enough in one sitting to actually get them low on battery.","In re to WM1000XM5First of all I will start out saying these are very comfortable, and the sound quality is excellent with Bluetooth when functioning.Battery life is satisfactory the first month of use, although I hear the battery is not replaceable.Noise reduction - works very well.","The battery life is pretty good it lasts for days.The price is good for the quality of the headphones it comes in such a nice fancy box that this would be a great birthday or Christmas gift.","These headphones add a whole dimension to music and what you watch or listen to with these.Pros:- Incredible sound, noise cancelation, and sound isolation.- Incredible battery life which auto stop charging when the battery is fully charged.- Included aux cable to allow for instant sound transfer (great for first person shooters to hear footsteps and shots in the distance)- Sound quality is great and even the pass-through sound makes everything around you as if you weren't wearing anything over your ears.- Extremely soft and comfortable to wear.Cons:- They are very pricey, being $100 more than the precious model.- Since it uses AI to automatically change the sensitivity of the noise isolation, sometimes it let's too much sound through.- The speak to chat is kinda annoying because I've accidentally inabled it a few times and then you can't disable it without going on the app.","The sound of it on and off as well as the voice that tells you your battery life and stuff is nice to listen too as well.","The battery life is excellent as well & finally the Bluetooth 5.2 is strong.","It's convenient and safe for commuting.The hear-through is OK. My Airpods Pro are much better at hear-through.The battery life last so very long.","With the phone app it's easy to see what the battery charge is at.Highly recommended.","The integrated microphones allowed for crisp call quality as well.I experienced no interruptions or cutting out with my bluetooth connection, it was stable every time.The battery life is outstanding, with only a half an hour charge giving you at least 30 hours of playback time.The headphones are extremely comfortable on my ears, to the point where I forget I’m wearing them.","Until the battery dies.","When i do a bench press or any activity laying down, it keeps falling down but this is so far the best headphone i ever had from the sound quality and the battery life.","Je porte ce casque pendant que mon conjoint joue de la batterie et ça fonctionne super bien!","I am also old school and would like to be able to switch out dead battery with spare, like I can with my H8.","This has enough battery life for any flight...IF you remember to charge it.","Durability of airpods is really questionable, I and my friends own couple of airpods, they stop working randomly (some times pairing issue, charging issue, misbalanced charge, muffled microphone, sudden sharp drop in battery etc) after warranty period of 1 year, and they are not at all serviceable by Apple.","A feature I honestly thought I wouldn’t need (I use my headphones mainly while I work from home), adds to the focus on the sound quality and keeps me from being disturbed by outside influences.Battery Life: Varies.","I personally think the battery life is more than adequate for an average to higher listener as my first full charge lasted 3 days of almost continuous playback (3 full 8 hour days at work plus after work listening for a few hours)Packaging: Comes with a nice case for storage, but a perplexingly small charging cable (I think it’s 1.5” long?).","It also allows you to know exactly how much charge is left in your headphones so you don’t suddenly hear that “low battery” message when it reaches 10%.","Excellent noise cancelling, sound quality, and battery life.","Enhanced even further with noise cancelling on.Comfort: 100% can wear these for hours multiple days in a row with little to no ear pain.Battery: don’t have much to say because the battery lasts for hours and takes almost no time to charge.Case: perfect, well built case you can rely on.CONS:black headphones are hard to keep clean because they’re Matte textured so all oils (including natural skin oils) show up on these like a black marker.Not sure there’s a way to replace the ear cups if they get gross.There’s a little hole between the ear muff and the head band connection point that I am concerned could fill up with gunk over time, not sure these are remotely water proof because of this.Would recommend these headphones, but wait until they are on sale.","++PROS+++ Paired easily to both my phone and PC (individually)+ Using Tidal as a music service to get high quality audio - sounds awesome+ The fit is comfortable, even for long listening sessions+ Good battery life--CONS--- The noise cancellation is good, but could be better- Setting up the multipoint connection (PC/phone simultaneously) was not as intuitive","Battery was pre-charged to about 65%3) Comfortable - The earcup are soft padded with a faux leather type material that appears to be of good quality.","I have had no issue of any drop at all.5) Battery/Charging - Long enough and charges quickly6) App features/Options - Multiple options to customize EQ setting, noise cancellation, transparency etc.7) Multiple device connectivity8) Love the Sand (white) color9) Sound Quality - Last but not the least sound quality is amazing.","I had been debating between these and the new Apple AirPods Max and so elated I went with these for multiple reasons (battery life, price, NC, bass, and more).","Noise cancellation quality is strong, mic clarity is improved, all of this is quite well known.Several flaws in usability makes the experience a bit deceptive:-You cannot charge while in a call, if battery run out, your out.","Incredible 360 sound, excellent base, superb sound quality and amazing battery life.","I would prefer to keep the ANC at the maximum level when I’m using it - and would be happy to trade more battery life for this option.Also, the XM5 software seems buggy, which caused the ambient button to not work sometimes.","I've had these for about 2 months, with heavy use.They have have excellent sound quality, battery life, and build quality, but basically everything else about them is crap.","so if you run low on battery (which I admit is rare), and you want to keep listening while you give them a bit of charge... you're out of luck.tldr; after 4 months of heavy use, I've concluded these are complete garbage, because the software makes the features actively bad for their usability.","even the long battery life isn't worth this BS.","I need more volume with the smaller drivers (and therefore I use more battery power) with these compared to my XM4s.","The AirPods Max case is literally really only useful to power off the headphones.Battery life is superb on the XM5s at 30 hours or 40 hours with no ANC/Transparency activated.","The AirPods Max has a 20-hour battery life which is inferior to the XM5s on paper but still more than enough for me since all I needed was 8-10 hours of run time to get me through the office for the day.","The XM5s can also operate passively from the 3.5mm analog port using the included cable in the event the battery completely dies.","Look great sound great, battery, only downside is the price but if this is your budget get them.","The one thing good about it is the battery life.It did not come with instructions to set up.","battery life is much more without anc … sound quality is amazing … just only 1 drawback that the leather ear pads are too much sweaty .. order a pair of velour earpads with them which would cost around 1500 rupees !","Noise cancellation, sound quality, battery life all get a 5/5, the ability to recharge the battery in minutes and last for hours is a force to be reckoned with.","The battery life is excellent also I'm getting 26 to 27 hours of life per full charge.","The app drains your battery and tracks you everywhere if you let it.","They are light and can be on for hours without too much discomfort and the battery life is ridiculous.","they are really heavy, not comfortable at all, The Sony WH-1000XM5, are very comfortable to wear, the battery last a long time, and you can pair them to 2 deceives at the same time which is a really neat feature if you are working in your computer and get a phone call, the sound quality is very impressive, the noise cancellation is good and ambient mode is descent ,  ambient mode is not as good as the airpods max, but considering everything else, I would go with this ones.","It is not an issue with the WH-1000XM5s.-- Battery Life: The Sony headphones beat the AirPods Max with 30 hours of battery life compared to 20 hours.","Battery life, sound quality, everything is great!","It's very comfortable, battery life is excellent and you can connect to two devices at the same time so I can receive calls on my phone even when I'm watching a video on my laptop➡️ My main reservations are the case and that it doesn't fold like the QC.","The headphones are very lightweight and the battery lasts between 24-48 hours even with ANC on, depending on how many phone calls I make.","So basically they sound good while their on and in Bluetooth but if you run out of battery and use the headphone jack they will sound horrible, luckily they charge super quickly.Comparison- I honestly prefer the 40s a bit more because they offer better sound despite not coming close to the ANC of these, they are not terrible but the ANC on these are next level.","The battery life on the XM5 is longer (30 hours vs 20), but this is not an issue for me.","Lose battery charge in 24 hours even when switched off.","I also have a pixel 6 pro and it worked as expected with both.Battery - Same as the xm4 which is great.Noise cancellation - Great and slightly better than the XM4s.Overall I think Sony sacrificed portability which is where I put these headphones purpose.","The Sony has a better battery life, is lighter and is more comfortable for medium periods of use.","A comfortable set of headphones with outstanding noise cancellation and great battery life.","Most of the time you don't have to do anything.Battery life is outstanding too.","On a 9-hour overseas flight, I use 10% of my battery using the headphones continuously with the noise cancellation enabled.","Charging is quick too, but you really have to go out of your way to drain the battery to a level where you need to charge it.Comfort is excellent as usual.","Years ago, I foreswore Sony products because of their poor reliability, ridiculously proprietary nature, and bad service and support.While this product still has stupid proprietary bits (mainly in software), they can be safely ignored, and the device seems to work well with both my Android phone and my Linux computers.The headphones themselves are comfortable, have good battery life, and have much better noise cancellation with enormously more useful features than my old Bose Quiet Comfort 35s.","Excellent battery life.","The Sony has a much longer battery life.","Love the sound quality, noise cancellation is comfortable and it doesn’t feel like i’m in a vacuum, battery life is impeccable, mic is great (very good at voice isolation) and honestly they look so cute.","Seamless connectivity switch between 2 devicesWorth the price tagSound quality-5/5NC-5/5Battery-5/5","I love the touch controls, the NC is great, the sound quality is quite good and the battery lasts for a long time.","The noise cancellation, sound quality and battery life is amazing!","Amazing fit, very light, battery lasting close to 40 hours, amazing noise cancelling and transparency mode.","Also after 6-8 hrs of wearing my ears are not sweaty/there’s no condensation in the cups.Battery life - superb, 10-15% drain per 8 hrs like what everyone says.","It does not block 100% of noise, but it is probably the best I’ve ever tested.Battery life is as expected, but if you like it loud with max noise canceling as well as the DSEE Extreme and Equalizer enabled the battery life definitely takes a hit, but is still good.Sound quality is really good.","The only good pros about these headphones is their battery life.","Not to mention the amazing battery life, it lasts so long and it has such a quick charge!","I do miss the voice prompts which are in the XM3's but the battery level is still announced when you click the power button.Sound quality is great in both however going back and forth between the 3's and 5's, the difference is quite subtle to me.","Turns out the headset was turning it self on and off so I'm back to turning them off when not in use for any length of time.The battery on the XM5's outperforms the XM3's however even those have a pretty phenomenal battery performance.Consequently, I met a passenger on one of the flights whom was also using the XM3's and he claimed he tested the XM4's and could not justify upgrading from his XM3's.The experience will certainly differ between individuals so don't take my review as gospel.","Did not provide the advertised battery life - The headphones with a full charge lasted at best 3 hours under constant use for video calls.","Amazing headphones, battery life is 'days'......a Bose guy for 15 years, no more.","Battery life is amazing, but that is to be expected from any premium wireless over your headphones.The touch controls have a bit of a learning curve, but they are for the most part very good (I have one issue with them, but I will get to that later).The noise cancelling is amazing of course, but what is more impressive is the improvements made to transparency mode.","Battery life is excellent and the carrying case is functional and sturdy.","This is my first time owning a ANC headphone..And Im just loving it..❤️Contrary to all other comments here,my primary purpose of considering a ANC headphone was to isolate myself while studying and diving into my Spotify playlists in breaks...Im using android devices (Oneplus 7pro And Galaxy Tab S6)My first options were Oneplus buds pro and Galaxy buds pro...But on a long term reliability standpoint,buds are not all great especially with connectivity and battery backup.So decided to go for the Best in the industry!!","9/10Battery-.","I find my voice very unpleasantly unnatural when listening to voice memos I’ve made.Battery life seems very good.","The battery life is really good too.The only issue I have is that I can’t control the volume at will just like I used to be able with the previous version of these earphones.","Wide dynamic sound good separation, great battery life, light and comfortable but I would enjoy deeper pads for my big ears but this would change sound signature, Like the EQ with LDACbut aptX HD sounds really good on Shure 50 when EQ'ed can't compare to planers as planers are more laid back Really enjoy the XM5","My screenshot shows battery life near the end which confirms the 30hr claim and from my experience, the comfort, noise canceling features, and sound all lived up to Sony's claims.Easy buy decision.","30 hours of battery, light when compared to their competition and the cleanest bass and treble even at the highest volume.","Battery life seems pretty strong too.Now the bad, 2 points, the foam in the cushion part that goes over the ear is on the light and soft side, it can sometimes be pushed back until it starts hitting the casing of the speaker itself, I would have thought it would be a little more robust more cushion around the ear since creating that seal is really important for the noise cancelation feature.The second point is, they also seemed to skimp on the foam in the band that goes over the head, I like it tighter on my head because I don't like the feeling that my ears are holding up the speakers, but the headbands lack of cushion means after hours and hours of wear it started to leave the top of my head really sore and tender since I'm bald my head lacks the extra cushion of hair so this flaw really stands out for me and I have to add an extra piece of foam on top of my head to have them feel comfortable for extended hours of wear.For these two reasons plus the super high price point, I am giving it 3/5 stars.","Using them outside on patio while I work helps drown out the AC and I never reallly wore my other ones anywhere but plane.I was really interested in the 30 hour battery life and quick-charge.","After having low battery on a couple of business flights in the past,  sensitive to losing NC while traveling.","The app shows percent battery left, which is good.","Good for saving battery I guess, but they're a little harder to pair via Bluetooth than my Cowins were.","In addition, the battery seems to last forever.","No issues with battery, sound quality, noise cancellation, Microphones all works perfectly.","I can see why this model was consistently near the top, the sound quality, touch controls, comfort, noise cancellation, battery life, are amazing!","Noise cancelling is amazing, sound quality and battery life are amazing too.","Good design but lacks in comfort and the battery life could of been better the touch control fails time to time have to disconnect from phone to make it to work again and the pause feature when taking them off doesn't work most of the times $566 after tax it's expensive with these issue haven't been resolved even with the new replacement are doing the same thing and it gave off a very bad static  when i turned it off yesterday","I really like the accompanying app that allows you to adjust EQ and indicates what noise cancellation mode it is in along with how much battery life is left.","While I was completely impressed with the superior noise cancelling, the terrible battery life and impossible audio controls (when connected to two devices), made me ship them back.","As long as the battery life

external amplification, and Amazon Music on the highest quality settings.Sony's DSEE Extreme is impressive at upscaling compressed digital files and seems to make even old MP3s sound better.","They are very comfortable.","I tried the Bose from a less expensive to the most expensive and to be honest The Sony WH-1000XM series, from XM2 through the latest XM5's are the hands down absolute best from noise cancelling, sound quality and comfort.","Comfort: I read about a lot of people saying these caused their heads to hurt; I haven't experienced any pain with mine, and I wear them probably 10+ hours a day.","Make sure to loosen them by extending them/pulling the headphones down from the headband, as it's easy to overlook this comfort feature.","Loosening them on days I have a headache or just want less pressure makes them plenty comfortable.","I bought these to accompany my MW75 and these fit the bill perfectly for comfort and style.Go with either the mw75 or these either way you won't be disappointed!","Top notch sound quality, companion app is actually useful, battery life for days and comfortable enough that you can actually wear them for hours on end.","The cuffs

your bestfriend for getting updates and creating setting that work for you.","Sound quality, noise cancellation, and comfort are all amazing.","The headset themselves are soft and comfortable, but not the most comfortable.","They sound better, they mute better, they last longer, and you can wear them for hours without discomfort.","They are SUPER comfortable, which is very nice when you are wearing them for a long time.","Only complaint is the overall shape isn't as comfortable as the XM4s, but I think I need to break them in a bit more.","Good :Active noise cancellation is fantastic!Fast charging is good, bluetooth connectivity is fine!The call quality is amazing.The app shows the SPL levels and it's effects on hearing which is awesome!Bad :360Reality Audio is a gimmick, should've had AptX HD, AptX Adoptive along with LDAC because with LDAC you cannot connect two devices at once.The outer plastic cladding near the foam pads push the frames and makes it a bit uncomfortable (those with specs are better off with XM4).Ugly:The sound quality is good when you don't EQ , but if you use their own apps EQ it's good only upto 70% once you increase the volume beyond it starts to distort and once you turn it all the way up the EQ just flatens and sounds like hot garbage.I don't hear beyond 60-70% volume but even if i want the volume to go to max the SPL doesn't go beyond 99db with any codec I've tried LDAC, AAC, SBC with their upscaler DSEE Extreme no change whatsoever.Also the change in volume beyond 70-75% is really not much and infact the headphones only start to distort!","Seriously Sony who thought of the no folding design?While they're very light and comfy, have great noise cancelling for certain frequencies, contain amazing call quality, have 30-40 hrs of

triedLouder volume than any other BT headphones I’ve triedOutstanding sound qualityGreat control and features within the AppVery responsive and intuitive touch controls - I raised the volume by correctly guessing to swipe up on the right ear cup.Love the case with a magnetic closure inside that stores charge cable etc.Very happy that they have included the option to use as wired headphonesAmazing battery life (up to 30 hours) with quick charge options (3 minute charge with a USB-PD compatible charger gives 3 hours of use)Can be paired with 2 bluetooth devices at the same timeGood adjustments can be made for a comfortable fitVery lightweight for their sizeCONS:My ears were sweating a bit after prolonged use…could be more comfortable","The earpads and headband are much softer, making for a significantly more comfortable and heat-free experience.","The earpads also do not rotate down when work around the neck, making the headphones quite uncomfortable when resting on your collar bone.","This headset is really great worth buying because the music comes out like magic Isolation is very cool and comfortable Do not be alarmed  The thing that amazed me is the battery, the sound and the insulation well.","This headset is very comfortable on  The head, it can be attached to the right side, touch, I highly recommend buying it Quality is luxurious to the end I really like it","Unfortunately the headband is too uncomfortable for listening for over an hour.","I've used Jabra's Evolve 2 85 and Bose's quiet comfort as my points of reference.Comfort on ear: the headphones are comfortable and fit easily over my ears, they feel like and carry a good balance of pressure.","The ANC easily beats out the Jabra Evolve 2 85 and the Bose quiet comfort ear buds ( this is expected due to the over ear fit)Auto on feature: In an attempt to push the boundaries, there is an auto feature that will try and guess when you want ANC on/off.","I can talk very easily and comfortably via bluetooth with no distortion, no noise pollution and no getting asked to speak louder.","PROS:- new design is lightweight and comfortable- headband is comfortable- touch controls are great and intuitive- auto speak works great- App allows fine tuning and settings- case is solid and slim- ANC is superb- sound is top notch!CONS:- matte finish will grab your fingerprintsI have sampled several of Sony's previous generations of the 1000XM series and though they were great in both sound and ANC performance, I wasn't won over by the fit and feel of the past generations.","These are over ears, so if they don't sit well or the headband doesn't provide a comfortable and secure clamp, then these will swim a bit.","B&W’s ANC was a bit more comfortable for me over Sony’s – I mean that by the level of white noise that the ANC provided.","However, this performance comes at a higher price than the previous generation XM4 (almost 25% higher) and competitive headphones from Bose and Shure, although slightly cheaper than the  Apple Airpods Max.The headphones offer soft leather-like padding for the ear cups and headband, and can be comfortably worn for hours.","This makes it easier to find the ideal setting for optimal comfort.For those that like to travel with their headphones, and appreciate headphones that fold into a compact shape, such as the previous Sony XM4 model and others, you may be disappointed with the MX5.","The headphones are perfect, with phenomenal noise cancellation, great sound quality and very comfortable.","These are the most comfortable headphones you’ll find in this price bracket.","Very comfortable.","Sound quality is great and the headphones are light and comfortable for long listening sessions.","But this is just in another league.These are comfortable to wear, have a decent enough microphone.","Wasted over $450 on the MX4, thought I would just get a replacement set mailed to me after a number times reporting that they just were not working as intended.MX4 vs MX5Cons:-Don't fold up as nicely as the MX4 do-Don't have the same audio alerts (power on/off) that I found useful on the MX4-Not quite as comfortable as the MX4Pros:-Haven't heard the digital sounds using the same devices-Have a slightly nicer appearance compared to MX4","I use these headphones both on Bluetooth to my phone and wired at my desk plugged into an analog music source.I use the ANC in all use cases, and it's really good for mitigating distractions.I have avoided the smartphone app and higher-level configurations as for now I just need headphones to be headphones.Wired Analog; ANC is optional when wired, and a full charge lasts for 20-24 hours of constant play.Wired USB; works well, and of course charges at the same timeBlueTooth; Of course not as rich as an analog source, but still sounds great, and when using as a 2-way headset I'm quite impressed at the sound quality and noise-rejection on both ends.Callers on the other end of a BT call report very solid sound quality on my voice.Runtime per charge is reduced somewhat while on BT, I'd guess something like 10-12 hoursComfort;Spring compression is about right to balance between comfort and sealing.It would be nice if the pad stuffing was a bit more resilient, as on the head the pads compress until my ears are in contact with the speaker grid and that can get uncomfortable after an hour or so.CONS;The ANC does not time out when there's no signal, which has left me several times with a dead battery when I've been interrupted, taken them off and forgotten to power down the headphones.One other \"feature\" that i don't really care for is that speaking aloud while ANC is on cancels the ANC and mutes the source until you manually flip it back on again.","The VA will guide you on the further steps)- The Noise Cancelling (Bummer), The sound (Play the 360 Spatial Audio video on YT)- Volume at 60% should be enough for most people to enjoy the music.- Extremely comfortable to wear for long durations and these charge really fast.- The Bluetooth range is good enough to roam around a duplex without worrying about fades.- The app gives enough customizability freedom.","I love how comfortable these headphones are, the improvements as in terms of ANC and the functionality.","You can adjust and set different sound profiles for whatever you are listening to.The headphones are very comfortable, and I usually hate wearing headphones.","The constant fluctuations in ANC levels are super distracting and uncomfortable.So unfortunate because everything else about the headset is great.","It is the most comfortable headphone I have ever used.","Comfort wise these feel comfortable, not too loose or overly springy tight.","Very comfy, the sound is incredible, and noise cancelation is from another world.","Design is more comfortable than the 4s in my opinion.",".They are super light and wow super comfortableThey so far have not had the white noise issue.","Except they pause when i adjust the head phones and my iPad is … I don’t know where.The transparecy when I talk is great… unless I’m clearing my throat in a noisy environment.So turn off all the cool new features ant you have the most comfortable, longest lasting XM’s ever… for $400.I’ll keeo buying…","I found the previous get not comfortable for my big ears.","Extremely comfortable and excellent noise cancellation.","The headphones are hard to wear due to being uncomfortably warm on the ears.","The noise cancelation is top-notch but difficult to enjoy when my ears are uncomfortably warm even when sitting at a desk.","These headphones are definitely more comfortable, but that is all.","I also tested them against a white noise machine that was 50 feet away, and they failed to block out this steady sound, even with music playing at a comfortable volume.End of Nov 2022, and end of the headphonesI contacted Sony through chat, and they had me reset them.","They feel cheap and the ear pieces don’t feel that comfortable.","The head piece is a bit uncomfortable after a bit of time.","So I wish this product was more comfortable, had now power switch, and had a dock with magnetic charging.","That’s very, very annoying.Those are my primary gripes.The battery life is amazing, the comfort is okay, the new design seems better (my old ones are held together by electrical tape at the hinges).I will be giving these one more week trial, I hope that some software update remedies the issue 🤞","The headphones are simply amazing from sound, comfort and amazing ANC.","The new style ear pads aren’t as comfortable but definitely appear to be more durable.","Noice cancelation, sound quality, weight, comfort, you name it the mark V comes out on top.","It create noise by itself.If you wear it , slightly shake your head, you will hear the leather itself tweak, make uncomfortable noise.","First let’s start of by saying I’m seeing so many positive reviews by people who never owned the xm4 or previous models they sound like promo reviews by SONY if you ask me, so you can understand the frustration by people who have owned previous models, first let’s start with noise cancellation which is awful on the xm5 no manual adjustments to the noise cancellation, and the auto noise cancellation optimization is a zonk on this generation Sony you took something so simple and nice and just messed it up, taking phone calls with these headphones were great and battery life is always awesome with the XM LINEUP,  now let’s start with the clamping force on this one I find myself having to lift the headphones off of my head because the feeling is so tight never had an issue with the XM4, the build quality on this one feels okay and the touch controls are much faster and responsive on this generation, the ability to not fold on this generation is a zonk to me as well but it looks like Sony is going in this direction so this would have some getting used to as they are following the other competitors with their designs as well, sound quality is great not excellent as everyone has their own methods and ideas as to what good sounding headphones are, until the noise cancellation is fixed, clamping force and more comfortable pads I don’t see the reason to try to like these headphones because they are the newest thing out, these manufacturers are putting out junk and not ready products at the cost of my wallet","The most comfortable headphones so far.","Very comfortable.","They are very comfortable has excellent multi-point connection.","I've been using XM3 for about 4 years now.I skipped XM4 as I heard it's not much better than XM3.As for XM5, as I heard it's got phenomenal features, so I wanted to give it a try.For sound quality, it is definitely alot better than XM3-Its directional sound is noticeably better than that of XM3,And music/movies/games just sound so much better.Some of the really cool feature it's got are speak to chat and multiple connection features.Speak to chat allows me to talk to someone freely without taking off the headphones.Multiple connection feature allows me to switch from my PC to my phone instantly when I get a call, or play a video on my phone.As for noise cancelling, XM3 seems to have better ANC.I thought I was able to hear more noises when wearing XM5, but it didn't seem that far off.My biggest disappointment was its comfort.Due to playing video games on a daily basis for long time, I sometimes wear the headphones for 8~12 hours.","XM5 doesn't feel as comfortable as XM3 when wearing for long hours.After about 2-3 hours of wearing XM5, it feels quite uncomfortable and it hurts my ears, which is weird, because XM5 is described to have larger earcups than that of XM3.Due to its comfort, I'm quite unsure if this headphone is worth paying $400 for to upgrade from XM3.","ALSO the top padding was oddly not comfortable, created a pressure point on the top of my head- maybe because the pressure of the tension holding them to my ears was not very strong, so the brunt of the weight was distributed to the top of the head band.","My only downsize would be comfort.","It’s not terrible, but Bose is WAY more comfortable, and my ears hurt a bit after long hours of using it.","i really like the way that they fit on my head, it’s just really light and comfortable to wear for hours at a time unlike other headphones i’ve used that start to hurt after 30 minutes of wearing them so i’d you are thinking about these i would highly recommend them for anyone!!","Great build/ comfort and overall happy with purchase.","Very disappointed by Bose because when I wore the 35 they were very comfortable.","The only thing Bose BARELY is better at is comfort but by barely.",")Comfort 9/10.","Pricey but incredible sound, great noise cancellation and comfortable to wear.Only drawback is they don’t fold down like the previous Sony headphone models.","They are so much more comfortable than my old headphones.","Simple minded old soul here - my wife has Bose Quiet comfort 45 and I purchased these instead.","Relatively comfortable and easy to use touch controls.","I've had them for eight months or so now and wish i had gone with something else.Pros: Good sound, comfortable when wearing.Cons: Auto-shut off, difficult to maneuver for one-ear listening.I've found that maybe I'm weird, but I often like to free an ear to listen to the room rather than the headphones.","The volume could be one setting louder, the noise cancelation 15 % better, but the sound quality and comfort makes these a great fit.","Weighing in at a mere 8.8oz, I'm able to listen to my music in amazing comfort, for hours.","Comfort is top notch and the battery life is amazing.","The noise cancellation was not great it wasn’t that noticeable, and the ear cups didn’t have any cushioning to it so it wasn’t that comfortable.","I can wear them for hours without discomfort, the noise cancellation is not perfect, but it's better than these Sony XM5s, and the design is so much easier to manage and travel with.","The sound quality, features, comfort, and price (well, for the under $500 price point) are unmatched to anything that I’ve ever experienced.Plenty of bass, treble, and midrange for anything that I listen to, with nice functional features like when my wife wants to have a quick conversation (I just hold my hand over the right side of the ear pad and the volume turns low) or if I want to say something without taking the headphones off, it’ll just pause whatever is playing, are nice little features.I’m sure that there are other over the ear headphones out there that are superior, but nothing that I’ve found at this price point.","My wife loves the comfort even with her multiple ear piercings (sorry, but I’ll have to buy her another pair), and on and on…The only thing that I wish it had was Google Assistant in addition to Alexa (but whatever, my Google home still hears me with them on), but I won’t even subtract half a star for that.","The ear covers are also very comfortable, sometimes over ear headphones give me headaches but I haven't had comfort issues with these yet!","Very comfortable, great sound, love them.","Super comfy and truly full noise canceling.","So I will be ordering something to add more cushion to them for my comfort.","The two shortcoming I have found is that the headband isn't as comfortable as the Apple (although I found the Apple's fall off).","Otherwise they have great sound quality, comfort and noise cancelation.","The comfort is much better.","These are stupidly comfortable.","They are super comfortable with or without glasses, sound amazing and battery life is superb.","I had the version 1 of this series (MDR-1000XM or XM1) and the ANC is noticeably better.Comfort: I wear glasses and these have the same problem as the XM1s had and they cause the specs to dig into my head.","This gets uncomfortable after a while.","I tried the Bose QC 35 series and they are much more comfortable with glasses.","It is fine, in every aspect, the sound quality and battery life is just a step ahead from its previously generation.The fit and the comfort though, is just bad for me personally, I struggle to wear this continuously for more than an hour, that’s where it’s really disappointing.","Comfortable but Design is flawed.","Very Comfortable to wear.","The comfort padding is also wonderful.","They're WAYYY more comfy than my EVO's though, like MILES better.","Finally I found over ear headphones that are comfortable to wear.","They are light and extremely comfortable to wear for hours on end.","Better look at alternate lighter options, as all the NC isn't worth the discomfort and risk to your health!","Great noise cancellation, sound and comfort, better than XM4.","Comfort wearing experience for its light weight.","Quality and comfort!","lightweight, comfortable and easy to use.","The transparency mode is good, it is not AirPods max clear but it is absolutely workable plus I don’t use it much so I don’t mind.CONS:They are not very comfortable on my ears.","If this is the 1st over the ear headphone for you, you might not feel comfortable for few days, after few days no issue on comfort.2.","The earcups were quite large, but very shallow so I could feel my ears touching the fabric on the inside, which led to an uncomfortably warm experience.","All good as this top quality headphones are known for.I dont give 5 stars as for my personal taste the volume is a bit low even at the max I prefer a bit more top vol space.The build for these highly rated top tier headphones seems a bit plasticky I expected some durable metal sections on the hinges and buttons, yet it feels well constructed solid and maybe the lack of any metal is to keep the weight down as they are very light and comfortable.Overall highly recommended even against Boss similar offer the Bass on these Sony headphones its noticeably a bit better.","Very comfortable.","Had to switch to this model because XM3 is becoming very hard to findI don't understand the glowing reviewsIt's a step down on the WH-1000XM3 in possibly every way except battery life, which was already long enough to begin withThe padding is much less comfortableBass was apparently balanced and boosted by someone who's deaf to lower frequenciesSize adjustment is needlessly fashionable yet unpracticalMuch more sensible to internal sound from your mouth, or the jack cable touching anythingThe right earphone touchpad sensitivity is ridiculously high, to the point it activates on its own at randomBut worse than all this, while my XM3 models died from the right earphone basically frying out in noise cancelling mode, and what do you know, the XM5 already has right earphone issues barely 1 week after purchase, as opposed to 2 yearsRandom crackling, \"underwater\" audio, issues which can only be fixed by... slapping the earphoneNeedless to say it's not going to last long at this rateAt that price mark this is practically a bad joke and a scam","But are a little bit heavy and get hence get uncomfortable after high usage.","Totally loving it.The design is so much more comfortable.","The headphones sounds good, but they are uncomfortable to wear for long hours.","These are very lightweight & can be worn for longer periods without any ear pain or discomfort.","If you can easily to hear all noises near around then what does it mean.Second Comfortability,  Your head will start paining after 30 min from the top side.Last Sound Quality: This headphone not for music listers.Poor Application, Pricing is bit high and worthless.","Are they comfortable?","They are comfy headphones in terms of clamp pressure after all, but considering the very disappointing sound quality combined with extremely cheap build quality, the XM5's have to be returned.Sony, if you're reading this, please take note!","They are incredibly comfortable, have crystal clear sound, and solid battery life.","The fit is great and they are incredibly comfortable to wear for extended periods.","The padding is good, they are comfortable for short durations, but I have yet to come across a pair of headphones that don't get uncomfortable after a few hours.","As long as all devices are signed into the same iCloud acct you can move the headphones from device to device with no effort.These Sony headphones are cheaper, sound better, and are lighter and more comfortable to wear than Airpods Max.Highly recommended.","The headband, in particular, may not be as comfortable as before due to its thinness.🎧 The microphone is markedly improved from the XM4, although I still wouldn't consider it a high-fidelity microphone.🎧 The transparency mode is still alright, not exceptional.","PROS1) The market's best ANC.12 Quick installation3) Comfortable - The earcups are softly padded and made of a high-quality faux leather material.4) Connectivity- It connects quickly and seamlessly.",").Coming from the X4s which I love, the X5s are lighter and more comfortable.","The headphones are also lighter and more comfortable than I was expecting.","More comfortable, better isolation, cancellation, much better sound quality and better build, superior design.","I'm looking for a super-comfortable set of ANC to mostly use at my desk and block out colleagues.Yesterday, upon opening the MX5's for the *first* time, the zipper was sticky and jammed at mid-point.","I also prefer the larger cups of the HD558 for comfort.","It gives me a very sore head after only 1h of use.People are saying I'm wearing them wrong, need to put the band higher on my head, I've tried this, tried readjusting the cups, but no real difference, and I shouldn't have to wear my headphones a certain way for them to be comfortable.When playing with my Playstation (Oh, they don't work with PS5).","And comfort is better than the XM3, no more discomfort after long flights.","They are very comfortable to wear.","I love how comfortable they are.","However, these are extremely uncomfortable to wear because of the ear cup design.","Aftermarket pads are available, but for this price I’m disappointed that Sony decided to skimp on comfort.","I can't speak to the noise cancelling or the sound because the discomfort of these headphones overshadows all of that.","I have a small head and most headphones hurt me due to to the clamp of the U shape, and the XM4s seemed to have a less pronounced curve so I could wear them comfortably for hours.","I was excited to get these and update my sony 1000xm2 which I've had for 5 years and are still working pretty well.The headphones are comfortable and the sound quality is good, however I'm dissapointed that the noise canceling isn't as strong as the sony 1000xm2.","!Weird beeping that I can't get to stop.These are crazy comfortable, but impossible to use.","EQ ffw.- Very comfortable for ears and very light.Cons:- You can feel the thin head rest digging into your noggin after an hour of use.- Black version will show your fingerprints.- Very uncomfortable if you hang them on your neck.Overall I'd say not bad for home/office.","I see a lot of comments about the comfort not being great but I found these even more comfortable than my Bose QC35 ii.","Extremely comfortable, can wear for allml for conference calls and not notice.","They are comfortable for me to wear for a full work day without any fatigue or ear pain.","These might be the most comfortable headphones I've ever put on, and I've purchased a lot.","They seem to function as well as much cheaper pairs I have, although those aren't nearly as comfortable as these.Great headphones, easy to work with, but the noice cancelling just seems lacking.","Fairly expensive and some reviewers had some pretty negative things to say about them, specifically the comfort and noise canceling.I recommend you go to a trusted audio review site now and read those instead of these Amazon reviews.","Your experience is much more likely to mirror those than the negative reviews.Amazing noise cancellation, great sound quality, and comfortable enough to wear for hours at a time.","Very comfortable and great sound quality.","They’re also very comfortable.","If noise canceling is an important feature for you then these are the headphones to get.My favorite thing about these overall is just how comfortable they are.","I have the Sony XM5 and the Bose QC45.XM5 definitely have better sound quality (the sound is more exciting, bass is amazing).BUT, and this is a big BUT, these are super uncomfortable.The earcups are super shallow, your ears will be touching the inside fabric and your ears start getting hot (really hot) even while sitting.I can’t imagine what will happen if i use them during exercising.The sound quality is not so much better than Bose QC45 that i will tolerate this discomfort.Bose QC45 sound might feel a bit dull compared to the XM5 sound, but the comfort is unmatched.Will be keeping my Bose QC45 and returning these.Really wanted to like these, and they do sound amazing, but the discomfort is a deal breaker.","I was disappointed with the fit of the previous model as they did not fully cover my ears and became uncomfortable after an hour of wearing.","They are fantastically comfortable and fit really well.Unfortunately, the fantastic headphones had two issues that kept me from giving them the 5-stars they might deserve.","The sound is OK but my old Bose were, I think, better.I have a big head (not in the ego sense) and these fit comfortably.","They sit comfortably in my head without squeezing it to death or giving me a headache.","Both of those headphones have excellent comfort with large ear cups and rigid headbands with padding.","They have 4 cm drivers that deliver very punchy audio, with the complaint of bloated bass that can be mostly controlled by EQ.I had high hopes for the XM5 model, but overall it is a downgrade in all categories except for microphone quality.COMFORT - The comfort on the XM5 for me is terrible.","The design, although incredibly comfortable, is rather plastic feeling.","They are quite comfortable and I wore them for several hours at a time and never got any pain from them.","Sound quality, noise Canceling capability, and comfort of the XM5s is just fantastic and its really a premium experience.","These headphones are comfortable enough for me to wear all day without noticable pain or strain.","The sound quality and noise cancelling are very good and, if you don't have big ears, they're very comfortable.","The ANC is also excellent.My only complaint is the comfort and build quality.","There is nothing  I found in their Android app to fix this problem.The headband in narrower than the XM3/4 and therefore more uncomfortable.For the price, seriously Sony, you couldn't add a bigger battery and/or wireless charging?The XM5 anc (noise cancelling) wasn't that much better and it was actually a little worse than the XM3/4 when it came to the dreaded landscaper's two-stroke buzz buzz test....Definitely not worth $400, and not even $350 if you already have an XM4.","New XM5 compared to XM4+Noise Cancellation+Call Quality+Battery Life+Charging Speed+Ambient Sound (Close to real sound)+Slightly More Comfortable+Many more minor improvements in hardware and softwareYou can reach me at my Insta for any information- imtiyaz.azhar","I have a big head, the XM5 fits more comfortably than the XM4 did, and seems to have better noise cancelling.","realy comfort","It is comfortable.","I am loving it.Edit 1:After using it for a day- felt extremely uncomfortable on one particular ear.","Right ear is not that comfortable but it’s way better than others.","Comfortable with great sound quality.","Good comfort in long usageDislikes1.","The cousins are so soft that even if I wear for hours and hours I don’t feel any discomfort.","I heard some people saying that its not comfortable because of its narrow headband and thin ear pads but i didn't find any problem in comfort at all i wear them for 5-6 hours daily while working and they are so much comfortable for me.","Very comfortable feeling.The noise cancelling level is just on and off, there is no manual level adjustment.","These headphones cut out most loud and annoying noises (some noises do still get through but they’re dulled, like your upstairs neighbours doing their daily “hey what heavy object can we drop on the floor” routine) and they’re comfortable enough to wear for long periods of time.","Extremely comfortable, Great build quality, Superb Audio ❤️","Fully expect a YT video on your laptop to suddenly interrupt your phone call out of nowhere.B) comfort isnt as good as it should be at this price.C) design choice of the ear muffs turning outward when worn around the neck is bizzare.","It’s great but if you have an iPhone like me it’s a bit difficult to get used to it.Light weight and very comfy sound quality is great once you customize it.I can wear these all day!","They are soft and comfortable, great sound quality, and the noise cancellation is unmatched.","Very lightweight and comfortable for long sessions.","The older Sony headphones had wider bands and were more comfortable.","No clue what causes this...but I don't think I can recommend these headphones anymore.ORIGINAL REVIEW (**** out of *****):I recently upgraded from the xm4 to the xm5.I had several issues with the previous version (main one being their flawed, slow multipoint BT connection which caused more frustration than the headphones were worth) but some things they implemented on these xm5s are a bit of a head scratcher.PROS:Great sound qualityGreat noise cancellingGreat fit/comfortLong battery lifeSlimmer and less bulky than xm4Better, but not great, multipoint Bluetooth connectionDouble click for spotify is awesomeCONS:Multipoint - still has issues and I have to restart either the headphones or the device it's connected toNot compact/No longer collapsable like xm4 - bummer for travelingHeadphone case is ok but much prefer the xm4 caseThe multipoint was so awful on the xm4 I gave up on them out of sheer frustration.","For my meetings I have to switch to another pair of headphones that do have a mute button but no ANC or long wearing comfort so that is the only bummer.For me, they are incredibly comfortable and the dual connection with my phone is the smoothest and most trouble free I have ever experienced.","Dogs barking, kids screaming, everything you can think of, and ANC is a requirement for getting any work done.So the good:- Ear cups are comfortable, doesn't crush your head after long periods of time.- Sound is good, not absolutely amazing, but good.","\".Sadly, I do no recommend these unless they are on sale and you DIY a comfortable way of wearing them for the top of your head.","For me, they are far more comfortable, with larger earcups that no longer touch my ears and somehow reduced pressure on my head overall.","Coming from the WH-1000XM3s I was expecting these to be a great upgrade in terms of comfort, sound quality, and ESPECIALLY noise canceling but unfortunately that's not the case.","I've attached a video with a recording made using these WH-1000XM5 headphones to give you an idea.Finally, they are very, very comfortable to wear.","Most comfortable headphones I've had by a margin.Bottom line?","As a dude with a bigger head, these are unbelievably comfortable.","They are extremely lite and comfy.","The improper fit causes jaw pain, ear pain, and just general uncomfortableness.","I've used them on an airplane and nearly all air plane noises are cancelled out.The comfort however could still be improved.","Like the XM4s IMO, extended listening starts to feel uncomfortable.","I was stuck on either getting the XM4s or these and ended up with these as they were basically the same price with the Prime Deal.The appearance of the XM5s ultimately made me decide to get these rather than the XM4s, but there is one important drawback I got from these: I can't wear these around my neck comfortably.","The way around this in which I found it the most comfortable would be wearing them above my ear, which is kind of obnoxious in my eyes, but it was the most comfortable position if I didn't want them on my ears.They are super comfortable and I find myself about to fall asleep with them on.","2) they're honestly not comfortable headphones.","Comfort is subjective though, so your mileage may vary.","In re to WM1000XM5First of all I will start out saying these are very comfortable, and the sound quality is excellent with Bluetooth when functioning.Battery life is satisfactory the first month of use, although I hear the battery is not replaceable.Noise reduction - works very well.","The XM5s are also hotter and less comfortable to wear over long periods of time.My other problem with them is that the noise cancelling is a bit too smart with the automation.","I had to turn this feature off, making it useless to me.Due to the poor seal reducing the effectiveness of the ANC to begin with, the smarter-than-I-want-or-need auto ANC, and reduced comfort of fit, I have returned the XM5s.","At 990Kbps, Sony's pull ahead but at the cost of significantly reduced range with my phone (maybe 4-5m and 1 wall, or just having the phone in my pant pocket and bending down can cause drops).As far as usability goes, these headphones are very comfortable even when worn for many hours.","This particular headphone requires no introduction so I'll get right to it; noise cancellation is pretty good but far from perfect but it is significantly improved in comparison to XM4, overall comfort for me is lacking in comparison to XM4, touch control and other features are noticeably better for me particularly the touch control accuracy.","As before, you can manually pause/resume (double tap), skip to next/previous (swipe forward/backward), and turn the volume up/down (swipe up/down) via the touch control at the right ear cup.≡ Physical characteristis/comfortThe overall physical design and style is definitely a step backwards for me particularly when comparing to XM4.","In my mind, it's not just a step backward but a completely failure for $500 headphones.Perhaps the worst of 'em all is the lack of comfort for me in comparison to XM4.","The flat headband from XM4 is much more comfortable for me after prolonged usage.","Although later I've found that the swivel might have something to do with my discomfort as well (can't be certain yet).","All [minor] improvements aside in comparison XM4, if it's NOT adequately comfortable, chances are I ain't gonna wear it, sadly.≡ ValueAll things considered, these are good headphones but are they worth the price tag of $500?","It feels light (250 grams) on the head and the soft earpads make wearing comfortable, even for longer periods of time.","These headphones add a whole dimension to music and what you watch or listen to with these.Pros:- Incredible sound, noise cancelation, and sound isolation.- Incredible battery life which auto stop charging when the battery is fully charged.- Included aux cable to allow for instant sound transfer (great for first person shooters to hear footsteps and shots in the distance)- Sound quality is great and even the pass-through sound makes everything around you as if you weren't wearing anything over your ears.- Extremely soft and comfortable to wear.Cons:- They are very pricey, being $100 more than the precious model.- Since it uses AI to automatically change the sensitivity of the noise isolation, sometimes it let's too much sound through.- The speak to chat is kinda annoying because I've accidentally inabled it a few times and then you can't disable it without going on the app.","After some messing around the EQ settings, these headphones are amazing and clear with clear separation between the lows and highs.Moving on to the transportability and comfortably of the XM5s.","The earcups are extremely comfortable due to the thick and comfy padding made of some type of faux leather.","The noise cancelling however is top tier and completely nullifies most noise which is amazing when doing work.In conclusion, these headphones were a league above earbuds in terms of sound quality, comfortability, ANC and NC.","The new design should be more reliable and should creak less, but it makes the case a bit larger so it may be less packable.Comfort: - The earcups are now a bit deeper with softer foam.","The overall comfort is very good for me, but you do notice a bit more pressure on the top of the head when worn for a long time.","For me, the XM5 is the most comfortable headphone I own.","They gave me an experience I never had or would have had cause I would have never bought them.They are so comfy (I have a XL head) I use these when editing videos during the early morning or night when I don't want to disturb the wife.","The carrying case is so classy!The comfort is superb.","The integrated microphones allowed for crisp call quality as well.I experienced no interruptions or cutting out with my bluetooth connection, it was stable every time.The battery life is outstanding, with only a half an hour charge giving you at least 30 hours of playback time.The headphones are extremely comfortable on my ears, to the point where I forget I’m wearing them.","-noise cancellation is wildly good-comfort is incredible with the vegan leather-great sound quality-took a step back from MK4 with no folding design- carrying case, consequently, is bulky and harder to travel with-for $50 less, you're just about as well with purchasing the MK4's but these are great and I would recommend","I find these comfortable and fit my ears well.","I'm hesitant to return it but after 2 days I have to as it's not comfortable to wear for me.","Sound, noise cancellation, build quality and comfort.","Très franchement je préférai mes Bose QuietComfort pour cet aspect.","I kept the bose 700, most comfortable, better sound and anc, best build construction.First impression, the material used felt cheap.","I love how comfy these are and how FAST they charge!","Pros- Great Unboxing Experience- Look is very Premium- Made from Recycled MaterialsCons- Treble is too Sharp and hurts my ears with \"clapping\" sfx's- Uncomfortable- Slips off of the Head too Easily- ANC is good, but not as good as what I expected- Oil from Head shows on these very EasilyOther- Controls can be a bit annoying, but I think they can be adjusted in the App","The EQ is nice to use- ANC is a bit more comfortable, you don't really feel a lot of pressure in the earsI'll be returning it because I can't use a headphone that hurts to use - a shame but I guess I'll have to wait for the next design revision - hopefully the headband can be larger or have more padding so the weight distribution is better","They are so comfortable even after wearing for a very longtime.","I sent them back and kept the QC 45s, which I highly recommend because of their comfort, durability, and style.","The sound is more bassy though, AirPod Max is slightly more comfortable for big ears, otherwise overall Sony is much better than AirPod Max.","The microphone also sounded equally good or equally bad on voice memo on iPhone.Also have tried Bose QC 35 II, QC 700, ANC is not comparable to Sony's, the sound signature is also not comparable, but QCs are much more soft and comfortable for big ears.","I have bigger ear than normal person and it's not really comfortable for me.","Enhanced even further with noise cancelling on.Comfort: 100% can wear these for hours multiple days in a row with little to no ear pain.Battery: don’t have much to say because the battery lasts for hours and takes almost no time to charge.Case: perfect, well built case you can rely on.CONS:black headphones are hard to keep clean because they’re Matte textured so all oils (including natural skin oils) show up on these like a black marker.Not sure there’s a way to replace the ear cups if they get gross.There’s a little hole between the ear muff and the head band connection point that I am concerned could fill up with gunk over time, not sure these are remotely water proof because of this.Would recommend these headphones, but wait until they are on sale.","++PROS+++ Paired easily to both my phone and PC (individually)+ Using Tidal as a music service to get high quality audio - sounds awesome+ The fit is comfortable, even for long listening sessions+ Good battery life--CONS--- The noise cancellation is good, but could be better- Setting up the multipoint connection (PC/phone simultaneously) was not as intuitive","Super comfortable.","I can say he is particular about sound and comfort of headphones.","Battery was pre-charged to about 65%3) Comfortable - The earcup are soft padded with a faux leather type material that appears to be of good quality.","These headphones are only slightly more comfortable than the XM4, however they tend to let sound in and come off my ears when I moved my head around.","They are the most comfortable headphones I’ve had and the sound quality is top notch.","The design changes, overall comfort (including level of head pressure) and potability have all been significantly improved.","The comfort is amazing, the earcups are really soft and the headphones themselves are really light, with no ear fatigue.","I have owned Bose quiet comfort headphones for the longest time and these Sony ones blow them out of the water.","You won’t feel uncomfortable even after long use…Overall, it’s a versatile product that can meet 95% of anyone’s expectations, whether it be a casual user, bass head, film buff, gamer or an audiophile","I got these mainly because I was looking for a headphones that fit comfortably.","too bad it's uncomfortable to wear because I have a small head.","Good quality sound, ease of use and comfortable to wear for long periods.","They are very comfortable, and my large ears fit into them better than the XM4s.","The size of the opening is bigger, but the depth makes them uncomfortable.","However, this much lighter design thanks to the materials chosen results in supreme comfort whereas the AirPods Max shows its weight after an hour or two on my head.","The AirPods Max feel like their price tag although it doesn’t translate too well in terms of listening comfort for some users.","Comfort can make or break them.The case is much better on the XM5s in comparison to the AirPods Max.","The Sony xm5 sounds great and are comfortable but the the sensor control on right side only works half the time.","Good luck feeling comfortable, unlike the xm3 and xm4, you can't rotate the heads on the headphones, meaning the hard outer plastic will be banging against your collarbone while you walk.","The most \"inconvenient\" thing about them was how I'd never want to take them off because they were so comfortable.","The constant fluctuations in ANC levels are super distracting and uncomfortable.","As a plus, they have oval pads which makes them super comfortable even with multiple piercings and kinda large, I’ve worn them 6 hours straight with no issues.","Headphones are really uncomfortable if put on more than an hour.","Sony has downgraded from xm4.The only 2 good things in this headphones are fast charging and sound quality.Don't buy if you are looking for noise cancellation, comfortablity or upgrade from xm4.","Overall, not worth this price point.Got these to replace my lost Bose QuietComfort 35s, and I can't help but feel these are basically a downgrade in every way.","They are light and can be on for hours without too much discomfort and the battery life is ridiculous.","I have premium wires headphones for \"real\" listening, but still desire hi quality wireless.So, to get the negatives out of the way.My hopes were improved audio and better comfort.I found them to be more comfortable then my Bose for long term wearing and lots of moving around.","they are really heavy, not comfortable at all, The Sony WH-1000XM5, are very comfortable to wear, the battery last a long time, and you can pair them to 2 deceives at the same time which is a really neat feature if you are working in your computer and get a phone call, the sound quality is very impressive, the noise cancellation is good and ambient mode is descent ,  ambient mode is not as good as the airpods max, but considering everything else, I would go with this ones.","The Apple headphones also offer more colors for a more personalized look.-- Comfort: The WH-1000XM5s are significantly lighter than the Apple headphones.","On its face, that should make Sony much more comfortable.","For my smaller head, this is quite comfortable.","It creates a point of pressure on the head that I find slightly uncomfortable.","if you manually turn on passthrough it will accidentally turn on noise canc ... this happens sometimes..- Fit is comfortable compared with others (Bose QC35/45 have also been good to me)- Bluetooth connection is stable 50+ feet from the source.","It's very comfortable, battery life is excellent and you can connect to two devices at the same time so I can receive calls on my phone even when I'm watching a video on my laptop➡️ My main reservations are the case and that it doesn't fold like the QC.","Sounds are so crispy the bass the vocals everything was amazing.Build and comfort(8/10) not sure if it's our ears but the headphones sit on top of our ears.","The pads are most likely made of some type of rubber which still feels pretty comfortable.Sound- I had to update this section because the sound is greatly improved with the EQ, the preset ones are a joke but luckily the EQ is super easy to use.","The downside besides the ANC is that the 40s are heavier and are not as comfortable.Overall these are amazing if you absolutely need the best ANC available.","In my opinion comfort is similar and anc slightly better, I haven’t travelled with these yet, I might add an addendum when I do.","I loved the comfort and connectivity very easy","Sony WH-1000XM5 is an awesome product in this category with great ANC, sound quality and extreme comfort wearing them.Looks are very premium, even to the touch of materials and cushion.","Very lightweight given the size and quite comfortable to wear for longer period of time.The carry bag comes with a USB C cable and a 3.5 audio jack.ANC is very superior in isolating even in a crowded environment, even putting it on without any playback is really good.","Tengo unos Bose Quiet Comfort con los que he estado muy feliz, pero estos Sony son muchísimo mejores en todos sentidos (comodidad, tecnología, bluetooth, batería, reducción de ruido, etc.).","I took them to work and they were absolute trash in cancelling out louder than library level conversations.I tried out the Bose headset and I can say those headsets have far better noise cancellation but are not as comfortable as the XM5’s.I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT MY BEATS FIT PRO DID THE EXACT SAME JOB… BETTER.","Also the xm4 are way comfier","First, it should be said the XM4s are superior to the Bose QC-35s in comfort, sound and ANC.","These headphones also fit tighter, i.e., more  clamping pressure.Simply put, to this user, they are noticeably less comfortable as the XM4s to wear.","With the XM5s, I was constantly fiddling with them to get the elusive comfortable feel.","With the XM4s, I just put them on and they fit like a glove.The XM5s are better than the XM4s in many other ways (8 microphones etc), but for me, comfort is king, something I won't compromise on.","I own the XM4 and other Sony, Bose Quitecomfort, Sennheiser HD 600-800 devices.Comfort is a little better than the XM4.","Wearing glasses I still have discomfort within an hour.","The headband is slightly less comfortable than the XM4.Sound quality is an improvement that was noticeable.","They have good noise cancellation and ambient modes and are comfortable for medium periods of listening.","Apple AirPods Max are heavy and after 45 minutes become uncomfortable on my large head.","The Sony has a better battery life, is lighter and is more comfortable for medium periods of use.","I have a big head and even the Sony headphones get uncomfortable after a straight hour of use and cause my ears to get hot.","The EAH-A800 are better at noise cancellation & ambient modes  and have great sound reproduction & best of all I can wear them for hours with no discomfort.","A comfortable set of headphones with outstanding noise cancellation and great battery life.","Charging is quick too, but you really have to go out of your way to drain the battery to a level where you need to charge it.Comfort is excellent as usual.","They're lighter, more comfortable, and have better noise cancellation.","The WH-1000XM5 fits well enough and is comparably comfortable.","Years ago, I foreswore Sony products because of their poor reliability, ridiculously proprietary nature, and bad service and support.While this product still has stupid proprietary bits (mainly in software), they can be safely ignored, and the device seems to work well with both my Android phone and my Linux computers.The headphones themselves are comfortable, have good battery life, and have much better noise cancellation with enormously more useful features than my old Bose Quiet Comfort 35s.","They feel a little cheap but seem durable enough.Comfort was OK but the lack of padding on the headband and ear cups was disappointing and caused a bit of discomfort.NC was really good as always.","I was hoping that with all the hype the 1000XM5s would be substantially better than the AirPods Max.The biggest complaint is that when touching the ear cup on the Sonys you can easily hear it, the same action on the AirPod Max is minimal.Both headsets have excellent audio, with the Max edging out the XM5s.Controls -XM5 winsComfort - I prefer the Max but it is more an individual choice.Case - XM5Ease of use - MaxNoise Cancelling - Tie","Very uncomfortable!I'm definitely not happy with the xm5 and will try to send them back!","I like how light these headphones are and how it’s comfortable even using them with glasses.","I have had many problems with other headphones because they weren’t comfortable with glasses on but these are so comfortable with glasses","It irritates my jaw after a long time and despite watching youtube videos on adjusting them, I just find I can't get a comfortable setup with them.","Comfortable and easy to use.","The noise cancellation is great and they are comfortable for me.","Supppper comfortable and easy to use.","They feel even comfier than my old set, I'm pretty sure it's because the ear cups are slightly bigger and/or shaped differently, giving my ears a bit more space.There was an update for these that just came out about a month ago (Sept. 2022)  -Improves the Noise Canceling Optimizer function (Auto NC Optimizer)  -Improves the wearing detection function  -Improves general performanceThe new update is pretty great.","The headphones are a comfortable fit at 8.8 oz.","Love the sound quality, noise cancellation is comfortable and it doesn’t feel like i’m in a vacuum, battery life is impeccable, mic is great (very good at voice isolation) and honestly they look so cute.","I know I was concerned about the comfort with the new shape and all but honestly it feels about the same.","Returning as they were just wildly uncomfortable due the fit.","PROS:-highest rated overall headphones for 2022 for comfort, sound quality, mic quality according to some on youtube-comfortable-decent ANC-honestly pretty muddy sound qualityCONS:-no mute function for the microphone-\"customizable buttons\" in the app dont have any actual options for the functions-no fast-charging-really good microphone, stays connected to 2 devices better than bose* returned mine because i need the mute mic function.","Black headphones also show a lot of visible smudges and ear cups were uncomfortable.","Best setting if coming from XM4's is ExcitedThey can be more comfortable and all but NC is way weaker than XM4's in trains and you CAN'T DEACTIVATE the \"Auto NC\".. not on the settings, not Ambient Sound, anywhere... You van set everything to Noise Cancelling but it still changes automatically MESSING UP THE EXPERIENCE.","These headphones are amazingly comfortable when wearing glasses.","XM5s we're marginally more comfortable, but not enough to make a difference to me either.The couple things that were much better was it's ability to auto pause when removing the headphones connect to 2 devices at once (XM3 doesn't have that), the ambient sound mode was so much better, and the headphones overall responsiveness to touch/button controls was much faster.As for noise cancelling, I'm convinced that there is variation in noise cancellation strength between each individual pair of WH-1000XM5 headphones.","I like the feel, comfort, and sound coming from the XM5, but bluetooth can be spotty if you have multiple devices paired to this.","Im assuming this would happen to these as well.I’m sure there was a ton of tech that went into them, but at this price point I expected much more in terms of comfort with the ear cups and headband.Sound quality is amazing, but again, comfort shouldn’t be an after thought at this price point.","Slightly tighter than expected and the padding isn’t great resulting in a bit of discomfort that I’ve gotten used to after a few weeks.","The design changes, overall comfort (including level of head pressure) and potability have all been significantly improved.","Comfort, hours of use, excellent sound, touch features, noise cancellation, no external sound leakage, ease of use.... the list goes on...","So glad I picked these over the black ones.Comfort - most days I have no problem with having them on for 6-8 hrs (my ears don’t hurt at all, sometimes I forget that I have headphones on), but occasionally idk what it is they feel slightly less comfy.","The only other issue is for comfort.","Don’t get me wrong, overall they are super light and comfortable but the light padding on the headband does cause some discomfort after awhile.","Overall they were comfortable and allowed me to forget I was on a plane by cancelling out all of the engine noise.","I already had a pair of Pro Ears Pro Mag Gold for hearing protection but wanted these to help focus on projects and be able to get some well needed sleep.These headphones reduce ambient noises very well but still enables me to hear when someone calls my name, even when sleeping.Pros:- Great if you rest or sleep facing forward- Pairs easily with iPhone and/or computers- Lightweight and comfortable- Easily adjust the head strap- Great if you need to block out room noises and focus on a projectCons:- Bulky and uncomfortable if you’re a side sleeper- Needs an introductory video on how to use the tapping features (pause noise cancellation to speak/listen to others)-There are multiple tapping features available for the headphones but I haven’t found any tutorials on how to make the best of themSummary:The Sony WH-1000XM5 noise cancelling headphones work great if you want them to focus on a project, listen to music or watch a movie however; if you’re a side sleeper and want these to help you block out noises so you can sleep I found these too bulky and they kept coming off.","I forgot to mention they are incredibly comfortable.","Additionally, while I could wear my XM4's all day long, these begin to feel uncomfortable on my head after just 30 minutes.","Finally, the ear cups require a lot of adjustments every time you put them on to find a nice comfortable position.","This makes them pretty much useless and super uncomfortable for audio/video conferencing.Another significant usability problem is the lack of a physical on/off slider — because of this, turning them on or off requires you to take them off and look at the status light as you operate the on/off button, which is slow and disruptive to whatever else you’re doing.Additionally, sometimes speak-to-pause will activate during a conference call despite the feature being permanently disabled, making you look silly as you frantically search for a way to unmute it.Back to my trusty 10-year old Bose!","The headphones are incredibly comfortable and you forget they are there, I have a smaller head and they fit perfectly, they have a lot of room for adjustment as well!","Performs much better than XM4 previous generation✔ Long Term Comfort – I can wear them for long periods of time (several hours) without any discomfort while wearing my glasses.","The audio library for the sound enhancement is also smaller for Sony with limited selections.Comfort: Winner Sony XM5The XM5 can remain on your head for long periods of time (several hours) without any discomfort given its lightweight feel.","When walking around the house, or outdoors, the XM5’s remains on your head without moving.The APM on the other hand are heavier and begin causing some discomfort after 1-2 hours.","The biggest takeaway is being able to keep them on for several hours without discomfort or pain.Build Quality: Winner Air Pods MaxThe APM are built to look and feel luxurious.","So I will sum my experience about this pair in three major areas Comfort, ANC and Call quality and Sound quality.1.","Comfort:These are very lightweight, people complain them for feeling cheap and plasticky thats obvious you dont get lightweight with metal constructions, having said that they provide enough coushioning you will ever need for long hours.","But since they are not as flexible as their predecessors they have a bigger footpring which isnt very comfortable carrying always.2.","If you use spectacles, you won't feel comfortable with these, even if you wear it above your spectacles - you will lose the pure noise cancellation quality as sound enters from the space caused by the spectacles.2.","I decided to upgrade from my mx3's and immediately noticed that these are significantly more uncomfortable to wear.","They’re comfortable - I used to get headaches because of too small ear cushions.","10/10Comfort.","there are 2 issues though, it is extremely uncomfortable on my head which is normal to large I would say and the LDAC bitrate mode selection is not remembered by the device so after each reconnection it is reset to the default mode (which is balanced mode: between speed and quality).","I believe their stated hours of use is probably right and certainly sufficient.I would not say they are so comfortable that I could wear them all day.","They are comfortable enough, but I definitely feel them.","These headphones don’t give me a headache, but I wouldn’t go so far as to say they are the most comfortable headphones I have ever worn, which they ought to be at that price.","They're lightweight, comfortable and I love the material!The sound is great: crisp, smooth and pops!I love the smart features of them pausing and playing depending on whether they're on or off your head.","The build material feels a little cheap for the price compared to the Apple cans but are super light weight and comfortable.","Wide dynamic sound good separation, great battery life, light and comfortable but I would enjoy deeper pads for my big ears but this would change sound signature, Like the EQ with LDACbut aptX HD sounds really good on Shure 50 when EQ'ed can't compare to planers as planers are more laid back Really enjoy the XM5","My screenshot shows battery life near the end which confirms the 30hr claim and from my experience, the comfort, noise canceling features, and sound all lived up to Sony's claims.Easy buy decision.","very comfortable, great noise cancellation.","Awesome noise cancellation, great sound much better than my Bose Quite Comfort","Battery life seems pretty strong too.Now the bad, 2 points, the foam in the cushion part that goes over the ear is on the light and soft side, it can sometimes be pushed back until it starts hitting the casing of the speaker itself, I would have thought it would be a little more robust more cushion around the ear since creating that seal is really important for the noise cancelation feature.The second point is, they also seemed to skimp on the foam in the band that goes over the head, I like it tighter on my head because I don't like the feeling that my ears are holding up the speakers, but the headbands lack of cushion means after hours and hours of wear it started to leave the top of my head really sore and tender since I'm bald my head lacks the extra cushion of hair so this flaw really stands out for me and I have to add an extra piece of foam on top of my head to have them feel comfortable for extended hours of wear.For these two reasons plus the super high price point, I am giving it 3/5 stars.","It's unfortunate Sony seemed to choose aesthetic over comfort, I guess in an effort to appear cool rather than to be super functional.","They take seconds longer to turn on than my old Bose.Overall, I don't feel like they are an extension of me when I put them on the way my old ones did, they are not as comfortable to wear.","The headphones are very comfortable, even for long listening hours.","Nice balanced sound, comfortable to wear.","Feel comfortable.noisy cancellation is perfect.","Best comfort, sound and ANC.","The XM5's are the least comfortable of the three.But all the youtubers that I watched told me that the XM5 were slightly more comfortable than the XM4s and the Airpods Max.","But on me, the XM5s are UNcomfortable within an hour.","I felt comfortable in the previous XM models.I must just be a bad person to disagree with the sponsored youtubers.The most comfortable headphones I've ever used are the Bose QC35 ii.","Much more comfortable, 15%ish better sound quality, and the customizable eq via the app is still amazing.","More comfortable than more basic headphone models for extended wear.","They're comfortable and I have a big head (XL hats only).","The features are as described, the design is comfortable and they look awesome!","I spend at least 2 hours a day listening to music so I wanted headphones that had great quality and were comfortable.","The sound quality is great, it is very comfortable to wear, and the noise cancelling feature works very well.","It had a very nice sound, good range of music type handling, wide soundstage, brilliantly executed noise control circuitry, high level of comfort even when listening for hours, marvelously executed connecting app were appreciated by me.","Charging speed is mind blowing, this pair looks heavy but the comfortness I get with the memory foam is just awesome.","I can see why this model was consistently near the top, the sound quality, touch controls, comfort, noise cancellation, battery life, are amazing!","The cups are really soft and comfortable.","Good design but lacks in comfort and the battery life could of been better the touch control fails time to time have to disconnect from phone to make it to work again and the pause feature when taking them off doesn't work most of the times $566 after tax it's expensive with these issue haven't been resolved even with the new replacement are doing the same thing and it gave off a very bad static  when i turned it off yesterday","Sound quality is fantastic  but my the padding is not thick enough and my ears touch the inside and it gets uncomfortable after a while.Also, the choice of material is questionableas it has a soft plastic covering the cups and within 5 min.","I got my new pair of WH1000XM5 today and I’m absolutely blown away by the sound quality, noise cancelation and comfort that these headphones provide.","They're comfortable on, the call sound is good from both the caller and callee's perspective, and the battery life is impressive, using them for a few calls a day over a week, and I'm still at 60% battery."],"all_scores":[0.8807,0.4404,0.8607,-0.3182,0.9131,0.6597,0.5106,0.2732,0.3612,0.5563,0.7047,0.6369,0.5367,0.8074,0.6369,0.5563,0.7822,-0.4186,-0.3197,0.2561,0.9103,0.5974,0.5106,0.5198,0.3384,0.4678,0.764,-0.4023,0.5267,0.901,0.7501,0.8832,0.8834,-0.3818,0.8957,0.9595,0.8519,0.5106,0.2261,0.1622,0.5563,0.2605,0.3612,-0.3818,0.5563,0.2508,0.743,0.8825,0.128,0.4588,0.9199,-0.5773,0,-0.0865,-0.6124,0.9531,0.1655,-0.3769,-0.2146,-0.3048,0.7425,-0.3898,0.8569,0.7086,0.3384,0.5563,0.8555,0.5563,0.8481,0.2028,0.795,0.4005,0.901,0.7906,0.6522,0.743,0.765,0.7982,0.9006,-0.3508,0.8695,0.9692,0.7003,0.6509,0.5106,0.5106,0.8779,0.3612,0.9393,0.5563,-0.4391,0.9575,0.8473,-0.6124,0.9169,0.6369,0.0404,0.9798,-0.2769,0.5563,0.3182,0.8689,0.908,0.5563,0.5563,0.8126,0.6652,0.8436,-0.0525,0.937,0.8689,-0.0276,0.5859,0.5563,0.8709,0,0.5563,0.9118,0.6361,-0.4023,0.8204,-0.296,-0.0387,0.4848,-0.2732,0.5106,-0.3818,0.764,0.9399,0.8779,0.6908,0.5106,-0.228,0.9805,0.5563,0.5563,0.8204,-0.488,-0.8068,-0.358,0.3612,0.2655,0.8331,0.8834,0.0516,0.4421,0,0.9366,0.5936,0.3612,0.7351,0.8929,0.9337,0.743,0.7964,0.0015,0.8241,0.8611,0.7684,-0.1681,0.9212,0.7783,0.3612,-0.4023,0.765,0.6597,0.0772,0.8492,-0.4019,-0.3818,0.5563,-0.5413,0.2846,0.5563,0.7351,0.6597,0.5106,0.5563,0.4133,0.8591,0.3612,0.4199,0.7351,-0.5454,-0.5996,-0.296,0.8622,0.5563,-0.9459,-0.5267,0.8422,-0.3506,-0.3178,-0.34,0.5106,-0.4929,0.7778,0.8805,0.7074,0.7264,0.3395,0.8176,0.8313,0.5563,0.9282,-0.4404,0.3612,-0.2255,0.0276,0.5563,0.8176,-0.4391,-0.2263,-0.5574,-0.2212,0.8441,0.1007,0.5499,0.6697,0.5563,0.1877,0.5563,-0.1408,0.8074,0.5719,0.8384,0.5563,0.7964,0.9777,-0.4939,0.9014,0.8367,0.0772,0.6908,-0.1531,0.624,0.7427,0.7269,0.7005,0.7172,0.0772,-0.8828,0.3976,0.6361,0.3612,0.5106,0.2516,0.4587,0.8126,0.6597,-0.4215,0.186,0.1513,0.0691,0.9197,-0.5432,0.8588,0.7964,0.552,0.5563,-0.9519,0.803,0.6402,0.6597,0.0498,0.0516,0.5956,0.5563,0.5563,0,-0.6249,0.5574,-0.0258,0.6597,0.9513,0.0767,0.3612,0.9039,0.2975,-0.2263,0.4748,0.9625,0.4019,-0.905,0.5563,-0.3641,0.422,0.5106,0.7023,0.875,0.5563,0.5859,0,-0.2484,0.5563,0.2584,0.8004,0.7089,0.8705,0.7845,-0.6191,0.3612,0,0.9165,0.6696,0.3919,0.7843,0.6418,0.6478,0.7363,0.6752,-0.4439,0.7769,0.8847,0.802,0.3612,0.7351,0.513,0.659,0.6808,0.4284,0.3612,-0.2023,0.6486,-0.7269,0.8271,0.8399,-0.5267,0.8402,0.7269,0.6597,0.5719,0.8519,0.6148,0.0258,0.7152,-0.4391,0.4404,-0.3843,-0.0433,0.9688,0.3772,0.4144,0.5563,0.5563,-0.3415,0.8176,0.7338,0.1825,0.9615,0.8055,0.6258,0.8622,0.8934,0.8905,0.3612,0.2609,0,0.7184,0.6712,0.5106,0.8402,0.3832,-0.4215,0.6936,0.7351,-0.3818,0.7574,-0.1779,0.802,0.9081,0.7227,0.7574,0.6597,0.688,0.2356,0.5017,-0.154,0.7003,0.6956,-0.6599,0.7351,0.8126,0.7351,0.9753,0.7003,0.9746,0.6956,-0.0258,0.8885,-0.3818,-0.2854,0.5563,0.961,0.3612,0.9239,0.3182,0.6808,0.7579,-0.5016,0.3612,-0.2846,0.1531,0.9894,0.5563,-0.3818,0.7269,-0.2942,0.8953,0.7738,0.6407,0.1027,0.7296,0.3612,-0.3102,-0.7075,-0.6599,-0.4391,0.5106,0,-0.4391,0.7678,0.6908,0.4748,0.9678,0.8957,0.9724,0.3612,0.839,0.9312,0.9479,0.6908,-0.5875,0.5563,0.7269,0.5719,0.7717,-0.6602,-0.5267,0.128,0.8899,0.5563,0.5106,0.8268,0.8126,0.8514,0.9438,0.7684,0.8122,0.552,-0.3852,-0.2732,0.3612,0.8591]},{"index":6,"feature_keyword":"price","sentences":["Needless

try them.","I don’t plan on killing the battery health and you should too for this price point.","It’s just a little overpriced by maybe $80 bucks, but you can’t deny the microphone quality.","That being said, it’s a good product, just a tad overpriced.","I was mainly deciding between these and the AirPods since I use entirely Apple devices and went with the Sony's for price and supposedly good comfort.So here are my pros/cons after about 3 months with these:Pros:- I have a huge head and I generally have stayed away from over ear headphones for long periods of listening.","A little overpriced yet worth it if you listen to music a lot.","This is just a fair heads up that there are ups and downs when ordering anything highly priced with Amazon and when choosing to do monthly installments on highly priced items.-Also be careful if you plan to order any other expensive headphones like Sony or Bose, the whole amazon returns and customer service are just sadly terrible when

dongle(s) for anything other than your cell phone or laptop… alternatively you can wire the wireless headphones, but from my experience, they lose all sound quality when wired direct (ps5 3.5mm)… so if you think you may watch / play ps5 at night while the Mrs is sleeping, what you’ll get is a wire to the ps5 remote and mono-stereo sound… in other words, when using with a ps5 or Sonys top 80/90 series oLED TVs… they’re about as good as a $5.00 pair of headphones from the dollar store… when paired to a phone / laptop they’re excellent… but imo, they’re way way way WAAAAAAYYYYYY overpriced to

owned.Pros:Best sound for the priceNice EQ settings (could be more advanced though)Clean & Modern DesignTop tier ANC (Noice Cancellation) (better than Airpod Max)Cons:Not as portable as XM4'sNot quite as padded as XM4, but still very comfortable to me (this is subjective)Pass through is not quite as good as Airpod Max (but remember ANC is better on XM5s)","PROS-Perfectly Balanced Sound Signature (Subjectively better than XM4)-Hands down one of the best Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) Technology-Lightweight and Comfortable (for X amount of hours)-Excellent Battery LifeCONS-Build Quality feels Cheap and Fragile-Earpads can Deform, get Hot (sweaty), and become Uncomfortable-Flimsy Case-PriceyOh wow!","It has some major cons that should not be present for its asking price (close to $400 as of this review).","At this price there should be no compromise and unfortunately I feel I have to compromise with both the Sonys and AirPods.","I understand that these are not audiophile headphones, but at the $399 price point, they should have a \"music\" or \"movie\" capability or setting to reveal the vividness and \"color\" of the original recording.If you read the technical specifications, it appears that Sony is aiming toward a reference or studio quality; the pure flat sound without any \"juicing.\"","They gave a 5 star performance across all boards, with a standout being in hip hop and hard bop jazz...two things that are pretty different from each other, but are good tests for audio devices.One other thing these have a slight advantage on over the AirPods Max is the price.","I still think there are some things that the APMs do better than these, but these are definitely work the price and in the big leagues when it comes to quality.I don't say this often, but with these...believe the hype.","But still this is something that cannot be acceptable at this price point !Go with it if you want steller noice cancellation and you listen at Max 80% volume.","Given the price of the product, it has big flaws that sony won't address in software updates.1.","Materials are really cheap for the price you pay, plastic can’t even stand a 1.5 meter fall.","!I am amazed and have recommend them to multiple people.They are quite pricey but honestly with this sound quality and this ability to be able to blockout almost all noise is incredible a whole new experience these are worth it if you have the money!","I know it's very pricey, but guess what..","Furthermore, with cheap wired and wireless IEMs providing better sound at lower prices than ever before, wireless noise-cancelling over-ears have become stagnant (in terms of technology, competition, and price) that the value of such a product is questionable.","If you are less price conscious, use the sony ecosystem or looking for a high level of ANC you will be happy with these headphones.","However, this performance comes at a higher price than the previous generation XM4 (almost 25% higher) and competitive headphones from Bose and Shure, although slightly cheaper than the  Apple Airpods Max.The headphones offer soft leather-like padding for the ear cups and headband, and can be comfortably worn for hours.","360 audio is available from premium streaming services such as Tidal, Deezer, Amazon Music Unlimited and others.In summary, these headphones are highly recommended, despite their fairly steep price.","These are the most comfortable headphones you’ll find in this price bracket.","When I first started using the headphones it certainly does live up to its price point and hype/expectations.","Don’t waste your money on this overpriced piece of junk or you will be sorry !","Not worth the price, had to return our set and our refund has still not been issued","It came with hefty price tag of near 400.","I will recommend this headphone to people who can afford its price tag.","while i do think the design of the xm4s are nicer, i think that the xm5s were worth the price difference (which was about $50 at the time im writing this).","And overall it feels like a premium product for its price.","Good quality but overpriced","I already knew I would be getting the best in this price range, but I was actually amazing that they improved on the XM4, because those are (were) top of the line.","These are the most premium you will find at this price, and they are well worth it if you are budgeting for headphones in this range.","Pricey but incredible sound, great noise cancellation and comfortable to wear.Only drawback is they don’t fold down like the previous Sony headphone models.","Sound quality rivals Bose which should be expected for the price.","The sound quality, features, comfort, and price (well, for the under $500 price point) are unmatched to anything that I’ve ever experienced.Plenty of bass, treble, and midrange for anything that I listen to, with nice functional features like when my wife wants to have a quick conversation (I just hold my hand over the right side of the ear pad and the volume turns low) or if I want to say something without taking the headphones off, it’ll just pause whatever is playing, are nice little features.I’m sure that there are other over the ear headphones out there that are superior, but nothing that I’ve found at this price point.","Firstly I would like to say these headphones are absolutely amazing and a great option for its price point but does not have enough substantial upgrades compared to the xm4.","Even with the high price of 399$ I think these cans are totally worth it.","They do the job but definitely overpriced.","This headphone NC and sound is at par with the Bose 700 but consider that the  700s was release in 2019, Sony still some ways to go and definitely not worth the asking price.","I do a lot of zoom calls and the transparency on these are definitely better but again not worth the asking price.","I thought by buying 400 USD headphones I would be blown away.Noise cancelling is nice, but, audio is as good as my 40 and 80 USD headphones from SoundCore and TaoTronics.Noise cancelling might be a little better, but definitely not worth spending 5-10 times what I had with my other headphones.I travel a lot so I thought, I'll pay a premium price to ensure I minimize any outside noise when on a plane or a bus, but it has come with a lot of problems.It pairs with my Win 10 computer, but, audio dissapears every now and then and I have to connect and disconnect.Would definitely return the product if I could, I'm overseas and these are headphones are trouble makers.","Great and worth the price","But it has a very Average sound for the price.","I would not recommend this product for this price, $200 sure but not $400 or more... Just not good enough to demand such a price when there are really good headsets for $100","Nah over hyped over priced not good at all.","Not worth the price","The headset itself is nice build quality, and the mobile application is nice and easy to use but when it comes to pc there is no application besides a community made one that doesn't currently support this version meaning that you cannot adjust EQ settings on pc using this headsets profile, but beyond that i've seen many reviews say this headset has deep, punchy, bass and that too be entirely honest is not true there is no bass and to top it off this headset has extremely poor bluetooth connection support for pc.For this price point if you are looking for a decent headset that has great bass for pc i'd suggest checking out razer nari ultimate.tl;drNo bass for music/games/etcNo application for EQ on pc only has one for mobilePoor bluetooth connection for pc will consistently cutout (un-usable)","What kind of service is that for a popular high priced item from a top manufacturer?!","I've tried many headphones over the years, had an older model which I still love but I decided to try these.I highly recommend these to anyone, don't let the price put you off, you get your money's worth with the quality,  sound and anc.Nice work on eco packaging too Sony.Beautiful case to keep them in too.So happy with this investment!","Probably my only complaint with the SoundCore headphones is the mic quality which causes trouble during calls in noisy environment (which these Sony headphones were the boss at).TLDR: Not worth the price.","Had to switch to this model because XM3 is becoming very hard to findI don't understand the glowing reviewsIt's a step down on the WH-1000XM3 in possibly every way except battery life, which was already long enough to begin withThe padding is much less comfortableBass was apparently balanced and boosted by someone who's deaf to lower frequenciesSize adjustment is needlessly fashionable yet unpracticalMuch more sensible to internal sound from your mouth, or the jack cable touching anythingThe right earphone touchpad sensitivity is ridiculously high, to the point it activates on its own at randomBut worse than all this, while my XM3 models died from the right earphone basically frying out in noise cancelling mode, and what do you know, the XM5 already has right earphone issues barely 1 week after purchase, as opposed to 2 yearsRandom crackling, \"underwater\" audio, issues which can only be fixed by... slapping the earphoneNeedless to say it's not going to last long at this rateAt that price mark this is practically a bad joke and a scam","I got 1000XM5 at a discounted price of ₹21500 using SBI credit card.","If you can easily to hear all noises near around then what does it mean.Second Comfortability,  Your head will start paining after 30 min from the top side.Last Sound Quality: This headphone not for music listers.Poor Application, Pricing is bit high and worthless.","If I had to pick between the two at their price points, I'd go with the XM5 strictly off the new design, but if it's sound-based, they're admittedly not too far off each other.","For example: Audio profiles can be customized or presets can be used.CONS1) The carrying case is large2) the headphones do not fold to fit compactly.3) It can become hot after a few hours of use.OVERALLAlthough it is a bit pricey, it is well worth the price tag.","Worth it if you're seeking the absolute best noise cancelation and can spare the price tag.","I got them at $329.00 so maybe my price impacted my over love for them.The technology on how you can control your music options, do voice option so your music stops is phenomenal.","it made this version more rigid.Overall, this is still a very nice headphone for the price.I would recommend it.","Aftermarket pads are available, but for this price I’m disappointed that Sony decided to skimp on comfort.","I love the quality of these, yes it is a little pricey but it is definitely one of the leading headphones.","The price is too high for a headset.","its half the price of this headset, and hits all the check marks for me.","Awesome sound quality and noise cancelation.Well worth the price.","I've never thought high-priced headphones were worth the price compared to cheaper ones but I'll make an exception for these.","The sound quality on these is really good, but not exactly up to par with some other comparably priced headphones.","I personally haven't had any  qualms with its size but I think it's something to keep in mind.Overall I think these are a fantastic pair of headphones and definitely worth the price if you're coming from the XM3 or earlier.","I just wish they were about half this price.","There is nothing  I found in their Android app to fix this problem.The headband in narrower than the XM3/4 and therefore more uncomfortable.For the price, seriously Sony, you couldn't add a bigger battery and/or wireless charging?The XM5 anc (noise cancelling) wasn't that much better and it was actually a little worse than the XM3/4 when it came to the dreaded landscaper's two-stroke buzz buzz test....Definitely not worth $400, and not even $350 if you already have an XM4.","A bit pricey, but you get what you pay for.","Quality wise, it’s nothing extraordinary, i think it’s pretty average especially for the price.","for a dollar more than the current selling price.","This headphones are small and feels cheap for the price, the feature are nice but there are better options on the market.","And as a bonus they’re stylish and they feel nice to the touch.The only thing that bums me out about these headphones (aside from the price) is that you can only register 2 devices at a time.","They also don’t fold, which might be a drawback if you travel a lot as they take up a bit of space.I tried these and the older models in a local electronic store before I bought them on Amazon and I found that while there was definitely a difference in how much noise they cancelled out, it might not be worth the large price difference to some people.","It feels a bit over priced but the sound quality and the built is better than its competition such as Bose.","Noise cancellation, sound quality are all good, what you'd expect from this series and at this price.","Fully expect a YT video on your laptop to suddenly interrupt your phone call out of nowhere.B) comfort isnt as good as it should be at this price.C) design choice of the ear muffs turning outward when worn around the neck is bizzare.","Up until now I’ve just bought cheap Monoprice headphones and the noise cancelling was laughable.This morning my wife walked out and said “Who was at the door?” I said “what do you mean?”She said some guy rang the doorbell a few times and was yelling at our front door.","What's not to like about them except the price.","Was a bit worried about the price but they are totally worth it!","I was so optimistic that at this price point they'd have a better fit range, but no.","I was stuck on either getting the XM4s or these and ended up with these as they were basically the same price with the Prime Deal.The appearance of the XM5s ultimately made me decide to get these rather than the XM4s, but there is one important drawback I got from these: I can't wear these around my neck comfortably.","The music quality is superb and I haven't noticed any distortion from higher levels of music.The things that would really drift me away, especially at this hefty price point would be:The lack of any water resistance on the headphonesThe ear cups not being able to rotate inwards or fold into themselvesTouch pad gestures should be able to be customizedBut other than the features listed above, they may cater towards you, but the XM4s are generally similar if not better than the XM5s.","When you look at the price of the Airpod Pro it was a no-brainer.","Even if the Airpod Pros were the same price as the Sony's I still would buy the Sony headset.","Also, couldn't find any good ear-pad replacement kits on Amazon for this product, wish Sony gave at least one extra set for this price.","Can cancel the sound a bit more but I feel like I am in a surround sound system .Def recommend- I know it’s pricey but worth itOnly question is why would Sony make such a short charging cable!?","All of these features [continue to] work fairly well in most cases and I particularly appreciate the speak-to-chat feature.≡ Touch controlI'm generally NOT a big fan of the touch control because most of 'em are just finicky to work with, well, not for this (and it shouldn't be based on its price tag).","All [minor] improvements aside in comparison XM4, if it's NOT adequately comfortable, chances are I ain't gonna wear it, sadly.≡ ValueAll things considered, these are good headphones but are they worth the price tag of $500?","For existing XM4 consumers like me, the overall satisfaction vs. price tag ratio isn't one that in my book worthy of the investment at this point.","I know the price is high but the sound quality is amazing!","The battery life is pretty good it lasts for days.The price is good for the quality of the headphones it comes in such a nice fancy box that this would be a great birthday or Christmas gift.","Very durable and definitely worth the price!","These headphones add a whole dimension to music and what you watch or listen to with these.Pros:- Incredible sound, noise cancelation, and sound isolation.- Incredible battery life which auto stop charging when the battery is fully charged.- Included aux cable to allow for instant sound transfer (great for first person shooters to hear footsteps and shots in the distance)- Sound quality is great and even the pass-through sound makes everything around you as if you weren't wearing anything over your ears.- Extremely soft and comfortable to wear.Cons:- They are very pricey, being $100 more than the precious model.- Since it uses AI to automatically change the sensitivity of the noise isolation, sometimes it let's too much sound through.- The speak to chat is kinda annoying because I've accidentally inabled it a few times and then you can't disable it without going on the app.","Sony is competing with several other brands and has priced this headphone at mid-pack.","I think it is matches or surpasses the others in the same price range.","This is great, since you won't find the same in other brands.Overall:  - For me, the XM5 is worth the asking price as the competitors are similiarly priced.","The carry case to me is a little cheap feeling I think at this price it should have a little sturdier of a case.The materials of the product feel amazing.","For the steep price of $500, I definitely want my headphones to tune every other noise out.The sound quality was crystal clear, it made listening to music so pleasant.","They are a little pricey, but if you can afford they are great!!","I purchased the Anker q35 at the same time, and felt the sound and anc to be comparable on both which was upsetting considering the price of the Sony.The Sony touch is EXTREMLY glitchy.","Unacceptable for the price.Original review below.I use this for flying, and in public where I really do not want to interact with anyone.","At this price point I expect everything to be excellent, and it is.","For this price I would have expected better engineering and quality.",":)AirPod 2 and AirPod 3 are just same (No ANC either) for all practical reasons, AirPod 2 Pro and AirPod Max comes with ANC, AirPod 2 Pro is good but comes with INR 27,000 price tag.","AirPod Max is also x2.4 times pricy than these (Whooping INR 60k).","And the special pre-order price they have mentioned is also a scam.","The price is the same even after release.","The headphone manufacturing quality is not good when compared to the price.","Sony is a lot better than Beats these days and better pricing.","I'm giving this 3 stars mainly for the fact that the price increased and not all of the features are completely flawless.","I don't think the price for an upgrade from the XM4's or other headphones in similar price range is worthy.","But does it deserve the price tag and delivers on that.","I had been debating between these and the new Apple AirPods Max and so elated I went with these for multiple reasons (battery life, price, NC, bass, and more).","The XM4s still sound pretty good, and I would not recommend upgrading to these right now at this price point.","If you're coming from the previous generation model, the differences are immediately noticable.The price has increased but considering there's a chip shortage and they improved literally all the right aspects of this new pair.","Just get a cheaper version or wait for this to reduce in price.","Very much not worth the price","Am not blown away by the sound quality but after tuning the equaliser settings, I am happy with it.ANC is top notch, it’s definitely best in that category, maybe beating even AirPods Max.Quality of materials used is right for its price, can’t expect more but the cushioning is just great!","these are definitely worth their price and if you are looking to upgrade then these are fine- you won’t be disappointed (al though there’s like nothing super crazy in terms of change).","Pros1) ANC (but not mind-blowing)2) Bluetooth Connectivity3) Touch Control4) Mobile Application with loaded featuresCons1) Sound Quality isn't that great for this price range2) Bass is minimal","Wouldn't recommend at this price point","I haven't bothered, but I think the fact that it's even needed for what should be a relatively simple device speaks volumes.If these were not priced at the top of the mass market headphones, their lack of polish would be forgivable.","But for the price, they're embarrassingly bad.update: my opinion of these has continued to decline with use, to the point where I almost want my old corded headphones back.","When I wear these overpriced earmuffs with the noise canceling activated, as soon as I say a word out loud, the noise cancelling goes poltergeist and shuts everything off.Waste of hard-earned money.","I also own the WH-1000XM4, and the cheap plastic that binds the headphones together broke on those.So there's my review of these (and every other) Sony products... overpriced and lacking quality.","Overpriced and falling apart.","The AirPods Max feel like their price tag although it doesn’t translate too well in terms of listening comfort for some users.","Not worth the price previous generation sounds better in noise cancellation and volume control.","With all the above Cons decently it is pricey.","Look great sound great, battery, only downside is the price but if this is your budget get them.","I wanted a pair of headphones for my game room but couldn’t find anything pink, noise cancelling and high quality worth the price.","That's not a quality product for this price.","Quality is not that different then some open backs that are half this price.","Overall, not worth this price point.Got these to replace my lost Bose QuietComfort 35s, and I can't help but feel these are basically a downgrade in every way.","I have had better experiences with headset 1/3 of the price.1.","Overall, I prefer the AirPods Max, but the Sony's have several strengths that will make it more appealing to some users than the Apple headphones (despite the WH-1000XM5's atrocious tongue-twister of a name).-- Price: Out of the gate, the Sony's beat the AirPods Max on price.","They are $150 cheaper at MSRP and $80 cheaper at current prices.","The question is, does the AirPods Max provide enough value to justify its higher price?-- Materials and Design: This is a subjective comparison, but the AirPods Max has the better build and design in my estimation.","The better price, sound quality, and storage are likely noticeable enough to many that they would purchase them over the AirPods.","At this price I would expect a decent case, even the case included in the previous generations was perfectly fine.","All in all, these headphones are impressive in some areas and have a few issues and flaws, but whether or not they're worth the asking price is entirely up to you.","Both headphones are not close in price but they do share the same features and are from well regarded brands.ANC- These headphones definitely have really impressive ANC, the sound is not the best but if you absolutely need the best ANC then these will probably be it based on so many online reviews.","So in reality the price difference might only be $50.","The price reflects the quality, but if it’s within reach of your budget or a bit of a stretch more, you would not regret the purchase afterwards.","I bought these headphones used and for a greatly discounted price and i have to say they worked and looked brand new when i got them and they definitely were worth the price i paid.","Seamless connectivity switch between 2 devicesWorth the price tagSound quality-5/5NC-5/5Battery-5/5","It was disappointing for the price.","Im assuming this would happen to these as well.I’m sure there was a ton of tech that went into them, but at this price point I expected much more in terms of comfort with the ear cups and headband.Sound quality is amazing, but again, comfort shouldn’t be an after thought at this price point.","The price has increased but considering there's a chip shortage and they improved literally all the right aspects of this new pair.","The price is steep but the performance and sound quality is outstanding.","I tend to be very careful when I make any purchase that has such a steep price to pay but I have to admit that I got \"exactly\" what I paid for and without one iota of regret.","The sound quality is better though, but for the price you’d expect the noise cancellation to be better than years old models.","Compared to the XM4's these are a massive downgrade and are not worth the price.","The sound quality, the noise cancellation, the design and quality is just not up to par with the price that’s being asked for.","These headphones are simply NOT worth the gargantuan price.","This means between the cable and the case; you’re looking at almost $100 of added expenses with the APM.Moreover, the price at the time of this review is $499 for the XM5’s and $779.00 for the APM.","The price difference between both is also substantial given they are close in most categories.","My beats solo cost half the price and I really enjoyed them better.","For the price they aren’t worth the quality","I did not expect it to be perfect but for the price I still don’t want to step out of a room to take a phone call because of any background noise.5.","I also tend to bump them less.Overall, these have good qualities but I don’t believe they’re worth the price.","I think you would be able to find over the ear, noise cancelling headphones with less glitches and issues for a cheaper price.","Previously I have used the 1000xm3's, those were my first proper bluetooth headphones and were the best in that upper price range in my opinion.","Great sound quality and software.. Could be priced better, not value for money product.","These headphones don’t give me a headache, but I wouldn’t go so far as to say they are the most comfortable headphones I have ever worn, which they ought to be at that price.","The build material feels a little cheap for the price compared to the Apple cans but are super light weight and comfortable.","I was a little reluctant to buy these for the price, but they are totally worth it.","For the price point, I expect the headphones to be damn near perfect, because of my job I have to wear these guys anywhere from 6-15 hours a day so every aspect of a headset is important to me.I am not an audiophile but they sound great to me, rich and stuff.","Battery life seems pretty strong too.Now the bad, 2 points, the foam in the cushion part that goes over the ear is on the light and soft side, it can sometimes be pushed back until it starts hitting the casing of the speaker itself, I would have thought it would be a little more robust more cushion around the ear since creating that seal is really important for the noise cancelation feature.The second point is, they also seemed to skimp on the foam in the band that goes over the head, I like it tighter on my head because I don't like the feeling that my ears are holding up the speakers, but the headbands lack of cushion means after hours and hours of wear it started to leave the top of my head really sore and tender since I'm bald my head lacks the extra cushion of hair so this flaw really stands out for me and I have to add an extra piece of foam on top of my head to have them feel comfortable for extended hours of wear.For these two reasons plus the super high price point, I am giving it 3/5 stars.","Obviously this comes with a bigger price tag..","For the price point of $350, these headphones are an all around disappointment.","While pricey, they really are the best noise cancelling headphones I've ever owned, and I've had several sets of Bose.","Definitely not worth the price tag.","I was initially hesitant to purchase these because of the price, but they are worth every penny.","I would have kept it even thought it is pricer than other competitors if it was easy to use, but it is not."],"all_scores":[0.4404,0,-0.1279,0.7579,0.7684,-0.6597,-0.4767,0.4404,0.6369,0.1621,0.2878,0.6249,0.5423,0,0.204,-0.1615,-0.2188,0.8176,0.1622,0,-0.3412,0.4404,0,0,-0.4939,0.8825,0.9531,0,-0.5574,0.4497,0.8047,0.6705,-0.3149,0,-0.1027,0.9276,0,0.2263,0.5719,0.3182,0.4201,0.5563,0.34,-0.5255,-0.1695,0,0.3612,0.5859,0.3612,0.2382,0.9343,0.4588,0.9366,0,0.8611,0.6237,0.2944,0.5499,0.3718,0.2025,0.9425,0.7184,0,-0.7829,-0.4226,-0.1695,-0.121,0.5983,0.9323,-0.7404,-0.9459,0.4215,-0.34,0,0.224,0.7269,0.5165,0.6801,-0.2263,0.7906,0,0,0.7184,0.1154,0.2724,0.8957,0.4019,-0.8828,-0.1531,0.743,0,0.6956,0.743,0.1862,0.5927,0.4404,-0.5432,-0.2869,-0.2755,0.3573,0.177,0.6597,-0.298,0,0,0.2486,0.8417,0.6406,0.422,0.8074,0.7574,0.9571,0.6317,0.7023,0,0,0.7184,0.6151,0.8702,0.8039,-0.4767,-0.5401,0.5719,0.4404,0.2382,0,-0.25,0,-0.3412,0.7003,0.796,0.4404,0,0.7481,0.6111,0.4939,0,-0.2334,0.9663,0.3999,-0.5096,-0.2755,0.5075,-0.5483,-0.2023,-0.4215,-0.1531,0.7269,0.3036,0,0.5574,0.0387,0,-0.0516,-0.3843,0.4404,0.5499,0,0.6757,0.4404,0.7184,0.039,0.5839,0,0.485,0.624,0,-0.4939,0.9239,0.4939,0.7579,-0.3079,0.7003,-0.1695,0,-0.1695,0,0.2023,0.7755,0.2263,0.4215,0.5106,-0.2023,0.6369,0.7153,0.4748,0.8957,0.3476,0.9253,0.9479,0,-0.5106,0.5667,0.2579,0.2144,0.2382]},{"index":7,"feature_keyword":"design","sentences":["These

ask me, so you can understand the frustration by people who have owned previous models, first let’s start with noise cancellation which is awful on the xm5 no manual adjustments to the noise cancellation, and the auto noise cancellation optimization is a zonk on this generation Sony you took something so simple and nice and just messed it up, taking phone calls with these headphones were great and battery life is always awesome with the XM LINEUP,  now let’s start with the clamping force on this one I find myself having to lift the headphones off of my head because the feeling is so tight never had an issue with the XM4, the build quality on this one feels okay and the touch controls are much faster and responsive on this generation, the ability to not fold on this generation is a zonk to me as well but it looks like Sony is going in this direction so this would have some getting used to as they are following the other competitors with their designs as well, sound quality is great not excellent as everyone has their own methods and ideas as to what good sounding headphones are, until the noise cancellation is fixed, clamping force and more comfortable pads I don’t see the reason to try to like these headphones because they are the newest thing out, these manufacturers are putting out junk and not ready products at the cost of my wallet","They are designed for Apple.","These are designed so well you hardly know you are wearing them.","I don’t know what huge headed people these were designed for, but I’ve never had headphones before where I did not have to adjust at all from the smallest setting (I’m a normal person with a normal sized Head in case you were wondering…).","This si my opinion after one month of use and i am very disappointed.Pro - Good Noice Cancelling- charing battery fastCon - Head band very, very unconfortable after 1h of use- No folding, the new case is much bigger.l- No NFC for connecting with phone- Sound not a big difference from XM2- designSomehow i like the new XM5 but is not better than the XM2 which is much older.First of all the confort, is terrible, the head band is very narrow and and not so soft like the XM2 and i believe XM3 and XM4 are the same.In matter of sound quality you have to listen very carefull to notice a difference, if you think are 3 generation apart you expect something better.You can't fold them, the new case take so much space.On the XM2 i had NFC and i just touched the phone to the headphones and the connection was super fast, super effective.Not anymore with XM5.My personal opinion if you have Sony XM4 or below the XM5 is just a waste of money.","PS> The pads are fine they are designed to be really soft, the only way anyone can say its not enough is if they have had them at least 1 year, or they have failed with-in short period of time I have not seen that anywhere & the material is clearly something ultra modern as well because its not the same as my other 3 HF's.","I own 8 headphones and this is a first...with headphones since recent earbuds (at  least top tier) seem to be designed to assault the ears.","It's also equipped with 30mm (vs. 40mm of XM4) carbon fiber drivers that are designed to produce more accurate (ain't they all?)","These headphones are ableist because they arent designed for normal use by severely autistic individuals.","If you used these newer designed cans along with the older designed headband you would have an awesome pair of headphones.","The way these collapse around your neck could have been designed to at least flip the ears

restart my computer to get Windows to send audio over the bluetooth connection, but that was an issue with Windows and not the headphones.- The headphones themselves feel of good quality and are super comfy for my average sized head.- The EQ you set in the app does persist when you connect to a different sound source.","The biggest thing with these is better controls for multiple connections to Bluetooth as well as convenience for quick charging if you forget to charge these overnight but want a long session for walking outside for example.The adjustment to your environment is more noticeable outside than it really is if you are indoors.","I don’t know how it picked the song, but once connected to my phone it started playing the most chill and quiet slow beats of a song I’ve not listened to in a long time.","Walking in the other room my 700s would start breaking and stuttering teh signal before disconnecting.","Also when using connecting to 2 sources the switching is seemless.","The electronics do correct it, but turn them off and use the included headphone cord in a passive, wired connection, and you'll hear what I'm talking about.I'm in no way dinging them for anything they do, or don't do.","But always disconnecting and not working with Teams.","And it's about damn time that the headphones in this series support multipoint connection.","I have a pair of $40 Bluetooth headsets, not noise-cancelling, that NEVER lose connection with my devices; but these Sony Headphones lose connection all the time.","There is nothing in my apartment that should affect the connection, which wouldn't also affect the cheaper headphones, but the Sony headphones always drop the connection.","When it is connected, they work well, and the noise-cancelling is great, but the frequent drops make this purchase a bust.","The sound quality is great, but every so often it disconnects from my computer.","The “I turned on” and “I turned off” sounds are distinct but I could not write down how to tell them apart (even if I knew) from the similar pleasant chimes for “ANC on/off” or “Bluetooth paired / disconnected”.","I’m hearing details I don’t normally hear.My only complaint is with connectivity.","Works fine pairing with iOS devices, but it’s NOT a supported device for connecting to a PS5 via Bluetooth.","You want quality listening connected to highend equipment, it ain't BT technology.","He can walk from one end of our house to the other with the Bluetooth connection.","Connects to all your devices very easily6.","Good :Active noise cancellation is fantastic!Fast charging is good, bluetooth connectivity is fine!The call quality is amazing.The app shows the SPL levels and it's effects on hearing which is awesome!Bad :360Reality Audio is a gimmick, should've had AptX HD, AptX Adoptive along with LDAC because with LDAC you cannot connect two devices at once.The outer plastic cladding near the foam pads push the frames and makes it a bit uncomfortable (those with specs are better off with XM4).Ugly:The sound quality is good when you don't EQ , but if you use their own apps EQ it's good only upto 70% once you increase the volume beyond it starts to distort and once you turn it all the way up the EQ just flatens and sounds like hot garbage.I don't hear beyond 60-70% volume but even if i want the volume to go to max the SPL doesn't go beyond 99db with any codec I've tried LDAC, AAC, SBC with their upscaler DSEE Extreme no change whatsoever.Also the change in volume beyond 70-75% is really not much and infact the headphones only start to distort!","Very bad connectivity, unusable in many scenarios.","I had a cheaper set of Sony headphones that had much better battery life.The deal breaker is that they drop the bluetooth connection at least every 20 minutes, sometimes every few minutes.","I just install the app and they connected without having to do the traditional Bluetooth pairing (Used Samsung S20FE).","It easily connects to bluetooth on any device.It has touch control on the right side of the headset that allows me to pause, play, skip tracks, control the volume, activate voice assistant and answer phone calls.","Hopefully software updates improve this feature, but for now it's turned offCase: the Case is nice and protects the headphones well, the ability to squeeze or compress the case is limited and should not be considered when choosing to buy.Voice: Voice is decently clear and acceptable for most uses, while not comparable to a boom-style microphone, I don’t anticipate these being used for business purposesApp + Connecting: The app experience is average and what you would expect if you have ever had to download a headphone/speaker app before, the essentials are there and it allows for easy setting adjustment and updates.","Connecting the device to computers, phones and TV was easy and intuitiveOverall: The headphones are a good buy in the high-end ANC range, be sure that the level of ANC you need matches these headphones.","There is a 1/8” jack as well for connecting a hardwire.","Summary:Very good noise cancellingTop notch sound performanceExcellent Bluetooth connectivityMore expensive than similar competitors, and even Sony’s previous generation XM4Does not fold into a compact shapeThe recently released Sony WH-1000XM5 (from now on I’ll just refer to them as the “XM5”) is the latest set of noise cancelling wireless headphones from Sony, building on the success of the previous model, the XM4.","A bit expensive but well worth it.30 hours of continuous use plus excellent noise cancellation.Also, does not disconnect or lose BT connection in crowded are with other BT be it in cars or headphones.","I enjoy even wearing them at home without connecting them to anything to have a quiet time with myself.","The connection is weak and doesn't support multiple room roaming.","If I have to give full mark, I will give it for noise cancellation(10/10) ,sound quality is also good as well as Bluetooth connectivity.","The bluetooth connection is solid, the microphone is a pleasure.","Connected to my phone easily and quickly.","Noise cancellation is grade A when it's powered on.But the constant connectivity issues forced me to return it.","Just not as functional as when they’re connected to one device.","I turned off the touch control in the app and it turned back on next time I connected the headphones.","No, it wasn't the phone, and it wasn't the connection, they just randomly power off.","Mine also seem to decide they are just going to turn themselves off while actively connected to a device and playing music.","These try hard and the noise cancellation is great, but the 360 sound is weak and just off..I got them for work, but the mics and connection did not do well with the limited use I did.Not bumming!The warning says no sweating lol, no problem these will fall of your head well before a sweat is broken, annoying.","I says it's connected but it wasn't.","They are very comfortable has excellent multi-point connection.","I've been using XM3 for about 4 years now.I skipped XM4 as I heard it's not much better than XM3.As for XM5, as I heard it's got phenomenal features, so I wanted to give it a try.For sound quality, it is definitely alot better than XM3-Its directional sound is noticeably better than that of XM3,And music/movies/games just sound so much better.Some of the really cool feature it's got are speak to chat and multiple connection features.Speak to chat allows me to talk to someone freely without taking off the headphones.Multiple connection feature allows me to switch from my PC to my phone instantly when I get a call, or play a video on my phone.As for noise cancelling, XM3 seems to have better ANC.I thought I was able to hear more noises when wearing XM5, but it didn't seem that far off.My biggest disappointment was its comfort.Due to playing video games on a daily basis for long time, I sometimes wear the headphones for 8~12 hours.","Even without playing anything, it muffles the noise enough that I feel somewhat disconnected from the crazy traffic.","With its industry leading noise cancelation system, you can enjoy high quality sound from  Bluetooth or enjoy the headphone's full frequency range of an astounding, 4 hz to 40k hz,  with its 3.5mm, wired connection option, while still being able to experience the sounds of the world around you.Either way, you get a wide sound pallet, from deep punchy base to crisp highs anda well defined midrange.The available software found on the Sony website, allows you to fully customize the way sound is reproduced by the large 30mm, soft edged drivers, giving you full control over how you enjoy, music, movies, dialog and much more.In my opinion, these headphones compare favorably against other more expensive premium name brand, noise canceling headphones available today.","Required only connection Bluetooth that means non secure for work.","I’ve tried resetting and disconnecting but it’s still low.","But their ANC is not as strong as the sony's.Bluetooth connectivity: They work flawlessly with a single connection and the range is also great.","The problem is in multi device connectivity.","When connected to two devices, it's not so great at switching to the correct host.","Like say it's connected to my laptop and phone and I play music on my phone.","It will stay connected to the laptop even though nothing is playing on it.","For instance when I would be on call on Facebook messenger or WhatsApp the microphone in use would be my phone's but I can hear the person clearly because the speaker is always connected.","The sound quality is no doubt amazing and I heardparts of songs I had never heard before but I could not take any calls while working and had to go through the whole process of either disconnecting Bluetooth or holding the phone Infront of my face.","Bluetooth connection with multiple devices is seamless.","The headset itself is nice build quality, and the mobile application is nice and easy to use but when it comes to pc there is no application besides a community made one that doesn't currently support this version meaning that you cannot adjust EQ settings on pc using this headsets profile, but beyond that i've seen many reviews say this headset has deep, punchy, bass and that too be entirely honest is not true there is no bass and to top it off this headset has extremely poor bluetooth connection support for pc.For this price point if you are looking for a decent headset that has great bass for pc i'd suggest checking out razer nari ultimate.tl;drNo bass for music/games/etcNo application for EQ on pc only has one for mobilePoor bluetooth connection for pc will consistently cutout (un-usable)","Overall, I found the default EQ curve on these Sonys to have too much colour, and the EQ controls in the Bluetooth-connected Sony app did not allow me to reduce this colouring enough.","My only request is to pls enable mic (if it is possible technically) while headphone is connected to PC via aux cable.","The headphones keep disconnecting from the device.","I tried with my iPhone, iPad, Macbook Air, Windows PC, and Android phone, and in all cases, the Bluetooth connections were dropped for no apparent reason.","Micro corrects, mais problèmes de connectivité, donc micro non fiable.Connectivité multipoint problématique.","C'est là, mais pas aussi simple et automatique que mes Jabra.Sur ce sujet, les Jabra sont les champions!À plusieurs reprises, le casque cesse de fonctionner sans que je sache pourquoi, je dois l'éteindre, le rallumer et retourner le connecter dans l'application ou dans les paramètres audio de mon PC pour que ça revienne.","Before NC700, my daily driver was QC 35 II.The primary reason is the multi-point connections and call quality — before XM4, Sony didn't have a multi-point connection.","But connecting these things via Bluetooth is totally hit and miss - at best.","Each time I have to go through a connection process usually several times - usually involving removing the headphones from the sound output device and starting to connect them again from scratch - before the headphones will connect again.","Bluetooth connectivity is great, and these connect to my phone very quickly.","However right out of the box the connectivity problems abound and noise cancel only works streaming music and then not that good.Today my neighbor came in with his new “B” brand headset and it connected and he was on a MS Teams call on his same laptop in seconds.","The app constantly thinks when you are on 1 GIG wifi that you’re not connected.","If you turn off your wifi then it can reach the internet on 5G.This is an ok headset for music ONLY but save yourself the headaches of hours of pairing and repairing and connecting and enable and disable if you plan to use this with Windows 10 or 11 MS Teams or use it for phone calls - noise cancel will not work - let alone use the mics on the headset for conference call on a laptop.I did find a resolution.","Never mind the wasted hours on connectivity for the Sony wh1000-xm5.","You can see the AG hands free option is paired but it WILL NOT CONNECT to enable the mics other pic also shows only connected for music.","This si my opinion after one month of use and i am very disappointed.Pro - Good Noice Cancelling- charing battery fastCon - Head band very, very unconfortable after 1h of use- No folding, the new case is much bigger.l- No NFC for connecting with

with XM5.My personal opinion if you have Sony XM4 or below the XM5 is just a waste of money.","Then BT connects.","PROS1) The market's best ANC.12 Quick installation3) Comfortable - The earcups are softly padded and made of a high-quality faux leather material.4) Connectivity- It connects quickly and seamlessly.","It also has a long range.5) Long battery life and charges fast.6) App features/options - Several options for customizing EQ settings, noise cancellation, transparency, and so on.7) Multiple device connectivity8) I adore the color Sand (white).9) Sound Quality.","In top of all the good stuff, i am totally in love with the option of connecting 2 devices at the same time.Watching TV not worried at missing phone calls, and when I answer the sound is so clear and other side can hear me so clear","However, the headphone kept disconnecting every so often.","Blue tooth connects easy.","I've done this for years with various headphones connected to either my Apple TV or more recently a Sony TV.","Unfortunately when it disconnects the audio plays at full volume through the regular speakers which makes it a bad choice for listening at night while my wife is trying to sleep.","I honestly can't find much that hasn't been said already that these headphones live up to for the most part.However the key issue (and cause for 2 stars off) is that for all these headphones can do (and despite some tricky connection gymnastics with the app / Bluetooth, though I chalk most of that up to the technology not Sony) you cannot mute/unmute your microphone in any way with this headset (at least not out of the box or through any settings or searching I've done) even though the headset has mappable functions, and even unmapped button patterns that i can only use for one service and cannot assign to any useful functions.","You can't connect these to the app on your phone if the headphones are connected to something else with an audio cable.","Interestingly, they would be connected without being acknowledged by the app.-I saw others mention the issue about sweating.","The connection was stable around the house, but I would still have to head back to my computer to mute/unmute.","The headphones sound muffled and flat when using the wired connection.","However, Apple has led the way in disposable headphones...and other manufactures follow.The app equalizer is very good and a must to optimize the sound.ANC is very good.Connecting is an exercise in frustration.","The app does not always recognize that the headphones are connected, quitting the app fixes the issue.","Also the dual connection of bluetooth is not good as it does get connected to two devices simultaneously but still the sound only gets played from the last device connected but it shows that its connected to both the devices.","ANC is very nice, And about bluetooth connection, While switching on it connect with my laptop suddenly but taking time to connect with phone at the same time ...","So many times I have both my phone and computer connected - I'm on my laptop, I stop the music then try playing something on youtube on my phone, but there's no audio.","No problem, sometimes I can just double tap on the xm5 to open spotify and I'm connected to the phone so I can go back to youtube and the audio will play...but nope it'll play the spotify music but not youtube.","But the audio on my computer still connected and works.","No clue what causes this...but I don't think I can recommend these headphones anymore.ORIGINAL REVIEW (**** out of *****):I recently upgraded from the xm4 to the xm5.I had several issues with the previous version (main one being their flawed, slow multipoint BT connection which caused more frustration than the headphones were worth) but some things they implemented on these xm5s are a bit of a head scratcher.PROS:Great sound qualityGreat noise cancellingGreat fit/comfortLong battery lifeSlimmer and less bulky than xm4Better, but not great, multipoint Bluetooth connectionDouble click for spotify is awesomeCONS:Multipoint - still has issues and I have to restart either the headphones or the device it's connected toNot compact/No longer collapsable like xm4 - bummer for travelingHeadphone case is ok but much prefer the xm4 caseThe multipoint was so awful on the xm4 I gave up on them out of sheer frustration.","They would never switch to the other device properly and there were ridiculous delays - whether it's connecting or playing another device.","It also notifies you every time a device is connected or disconnected from the headphones - which is great but I wish I could turn this off since it constantly pings when I go out to the laundry room with my loads of clothes and disconnect or connect to my laptop.I'm happy with these headphones but really wish there was a more elegant way to carry them around.","As well as if your Bluetooth connection to your iPhone the iPhone will display his battery level as well.","For my meetings I have to switch to another pair of headphones that do have a mute button but no ANC or long wearing comfort so that is the only bummer.For me, they are incredibly comfortable and the dual connection with my phone is the smoothest and most trouble free I have ever experienced.","Edit after 5 months of use:Disconnects are more frequent, and at times it would suddenly lower the audio quality.","The only way to fix it is to stop everything you're doing, turn it off, turn it on, and hope it reconnects.","**Edit after a month of use:Using Multi-device connection is very spotty, 3 out of 10 times the headphones will completely turn off without warning, even with a full battery.","Only thing I hate is that if I have my phone and laptop connected, and I paused media on my laptop.","Great sound quality, solid materials, great connectivity and range, but I have to return them.","However, and this is a big one, sometimes there are problems with connections.","Every time I try to connect them, my headphones make this weird noise and get disconnected automatically.","But there are a couple of major flaws that resulted in me returning them: 1) the Bluetooth connectivity with both my Pixel and my Macbook Pro was very unstable and unpredictable.","1) Random turn off (not power or user interaction related, and not related to \"keep on while wearing\" setting, _OR_ (2) no sound is output for headphones even though PC shows connected, the player is playing.","It takes about 10-20 seconds to get back to working for the stack to re-establish the connection..- In the case of random pauses of your YouTube player.","The only problem I have is that depending where in our house we are located the headphones disconnects a lot!","It does have Bluetooth connectivity as well, and it can be connected to two devices at the same time!","if it is connected to both a phone and a computer, whenever the call comes in, it will automatically stop the music playing on the computer and switch to the phone so you won't ever miss an important call again!The most outstanding features of these headphones, in my opinion, are the smart features, which you can turn on/off as you need.","With Sony's headphone app it was very easy to connect them both my phone and my laptop as well due to its \"multiple device connectivity\".","The integrated microphones allowed for crisp call quality as well.I experienced no interruptions or cutting out with my bluetooth connection, it was stable every time.The battery life is outstanding, with only a half an hour charge giving you at least 30 hours of playback time.The headphones are extremely comfortable on my ears, to the point where I forget I’m wearing them.","These headphones had everything I wanted - ANC, two connections at once, great sound, but I couldn't keep them on my head for more than 30 minutes without the headband hurting the top of my head.","The auto-noise cancellation optimizer is nice, overall I’ve had less issues with connectivity (i.e.","At first, I had a hard time connecting it to my macbook but it connected so no problem.","Inital connection to my pixel 6 phone was easy.","The headphones also support wired connection which is good so you get better quality but xm5 is not supporting mic with wired connection.","Enhanced even further with noise cancelling on.Comfort: 100% can wear these for hours multiple days in a row with little to no ear pain.Battery: don’t have much to say because the battery lasts for hours and takes almost no time to charge.Case: perfect, well built case you can rely on.CONS:black headphones are hard to keep clean because they’re Matte textured so all oils (including natural skin oils) show up on these like a black marker.Not sure there’s a way to replace the ear cups if they get gross.There’s a little hole between the ear muff and the head band connection point that I am concerned could fill up with gunk over time, not sure these are remotely water proof because of this.Would recommend these headphones, but wait until they are on sale.","Not to say that there are any controls missing but I'd prefer to customize it.Lastly, something about connecting to 2 devices simultaneously is that it works but not seamlessly.","For example, when I'm connected to my phone and playing music on it, the headphone doesn't change to iPad automatically when I start to play a video on the iPad.","This is still easier than disconnecting and reconnecting devices but could be improved(maybe?","++PROS+++ Paired easily to both my phone and PC (individually)+ Using Tidal as a music service to get high quality audio - sounds awesome+ The fit is comfortable, even for long listening sessions+ Good battery life--CONS--- The noise cancellation is good, but could be better- Setting up the multipoint connection (PC/phone simultaneously) was not as intuitive","Will have to see how it performs during sweaty, hot environment.4) Connectivity- It connect seamless, and quickly.","I can literally walk all around in my home or in my backyard away from my phone and it stay connected.","I have had no issue of any drop at all.5) Battery/Charging - Long enough and charges quickly6) App features/Options - Multiple options to customize EQ setting, noise cancellation, transparency etc.7) Multiple device connectivity8) Love the Sand (white) color9) Sound Quality - Last but not the least sound quality is amazing.","They wouldn’t stay connected to any device and randomly disconnected.","The Bluetooth connection does need to be set EACH time I use it with any apple products.","The new pair sometimes disconnects randomly but not much and a quick button click gets it back on.","The foam padding could definitely be a bit denser as it does deform easily.My biggest problem was that they had issues connecting to my Bluetooth receiver I bought for my TV.","big issue in call.-Sound notification (on, off, pairing, connected), are so random, you don't know what's

should sound, having said that The default Audio quality is decent also it varies which device you are connected, I wud suggest that you should use them with LDAC enabled all the time!!","After only two weeks, the hinge connecting the earcup to the headband broke.","It turns out there's almost no material connecting the earcup and holding it in place.","The bluetooth randomly disconnects from the device.","It's not often but if you listen for maybe 5 hours a day, it will surely happen at least once, maybe even twice (even more so if you are connected to your computer) Not only that, sometimes the power will even randomly shut off.","I almost want to put up with the inconvenience of the connection issues, but I paid $400 for these, so out of principle I need to return them!","Looses the blue tooth connection.","Always reconnecting.Not worth the return hassel as we live in the mountains.","So I got these to go along with my new Walkman after being unimpressed with the Bose 700’s audio quality when connected to a system with an actual audio processor.My god.I haven’t had this good of an audio experience in decades.","I don't need a bell in my ears when blue tooth connects.- I ordered a used set off amazon warehouse, the case left indents on the ear muffs.","The first time you turn it on or if you turn it on in pairing mode a picture of the headphones will pop up on a nearby android device and you just click connect, it is as simple as connecting air pods to an iPhone.Onto these headphones, they are exceptional.","This is my first time owning a ANC headphone..And Im just loving it..❤️Contrary to all other comments here,my primary purpose of considering a ANC headphone was to isolate myself while studying and diving into my Spotify playlists in breaks...Im using android devices (Oneplus 7pro And Galaxy Tab S6)My first options were Oneplus buds pro and Galaxy buds pro...But on a long term reliability standpoint,buds are not all great especially with connectivity and battery backup.So decided to go for the Best in the industry!!","10/10Connectivity-  9.5/10App experience- 9.5/10Cons:It does not fold like XM4's (That means there will be less hinge issues in long term)Larger case.","The connectivity through 2 rooms away is spotless.. the noise canceling is woo..About the audio.. use wavelet and the sony app to eq ur music and the levels, the spacing and the crisp treble and bass is superb.. simply superb..","(For those like airpods pro user or who are finding bass too muffled can try this EQ, hope that will help)•Silver colour isn’t attracting visible smudges as much as the black ones.•Connectivity and touch functions are butter smooth.•Call clarity with zooms or Microsoft teams is just amazing.•Siri responses to input commands by long pressing right earcup.","there are 2 issues though, it is extremely uncomfortable on my head which is normal to large I would say and the LDAC bitrate mode selection is not remembered by the device so after each reconnection it is reset to the default mode (which is balanced mode: between speed and quality).","Connection to iPhone is problematic","May have been some setting or Bluetooth connection problem.","It had a very nice sound, good range of music type handling, wide soundstage, brilliantly executed noise control circuitry, high level of comfort even when listening for hours, marvelously executed connecting app were appreciated by me.","Thats why I reduced one star in Bluetooth connectivity.","No custom functionality to mute the mic which a major requirement for a wireless headphones, what's the point in having a wireless headphones and have to mute in the PC/device connected to.Audio lad issues when connected with Samsung TVs.","I also don’t notice an incredibly large difference between the sound quality in Bluetooth vs wired connection.","While I was completely impressed with the superior noise cancelling, the terrible battery life and impossible audio controls (when connected to two devices), made me ship them back.","The multi-device connectivity fairly flawless.","I connected it initially with my Samsung tablet, when I went to conect it to the cell phone, it asked for the tablet to connect instead of just using the

a hobbyist musician and sound engineer of 20 years and also mild audiophile that builds my own speakers.","I like to think I know a little bit about sound and what it takes to reproduce sound, but the tricky thing with headphones is that everybody's' ears are different.","Like, they're physically slightly different which makes every single person hear the exact same sound slightly different, but there's also our individual listening preferences too, so keep that in mind as you read this review.","I did have to restart my computer to get Windows to send audio over the bluetooth connection, but that was an issue with Windows and not the headphones.- The headphones themselves feel of good quality and are super comfy for my average sized head.- The EQ you set in the app does persist when you connect to a different sound source.","Sony, you can do better than just 5 predefined sliders and a bass slider (basically 6 sliders, so IDK why the bass is separate from the rest).Listening impressions:- Best sounding headset I've purchased to date and sound MILES better than my Sennheiser HD 596 (but to be fair, those sounded ridiculously unnatural and just all-around terrible).- Plenty of \"thump\" by default, but definitely dropping off significantly below 50Hz or so, which is exactly what I like to have present in my mix.","You can see I've put a HUGE boost in the low lows on my EQ curve to make things like low synths, bass drops, and sub-harmonics sound even with the rest of the sound stage.","Even still, the sub-bass that is there still sounds a bit thin and artificial like they're using some processing trickery to make it sound like it's playing lower than it is (there are a few ways to do this, but they're never as authentic as just reproducing the frequency properly).- Little bit \"dark\" sounding, so a slight bump in the high mids as well as a 10k+ shelf bump really helped brighten up the sound stage.- Imaging is ok but definitely not spectacular.","They sound good enough (especially with some EQ), and are comfy enough, to have some background music playing for hours at a time while also cancelling out loud office talkers.","It's an even bigger deal with these as they'll adjust sound and I could see if suction was lost at an inopportune moment it could be...uncomfortable.RE: HairY'all, your hair is going to need to be out of the way.","I won't notice it immediately but when I move around or talk I'll notice a sound change (almost like a varying level of wubba womp like entering a tunnel or in elevation changes) and at the corresponding ear I'll find hair between my ear and headphones.","For some reason any adjustment i made unpaused my TV and swapped where the sound was coming from.","I mostly dont need this anyway but thought it might be nice for my neighbors late at night.Summation without even talking about its sound quality, noise cancelation and other functions (which are amazing):These headphones are worth the price tag for the lack of weight on my temples ALONE.","Shares the same features like the XM5, not the same sound like over the ear obviously but also more marketed to those who goes to the gym and likes something more compact.Pros:Comfortable and lightweight!I don't ever have a complaint with what they have to offer when it comes to comfort.","Helps when your hands are busy and or you just don't want to adjust your headphones having to speak.Superb sound!The sound quality out of these are amazing!","My biggest priorities for headphones is comfort, sound quality (both for music and phone calls), and noise cancellation.ComfortThe XM5’s have ear cups that are slightly larger than the XM4s and they also look slightly larger than the NC700s.","But both are great.Sound QualityThis is a matter of preference, but I prefer the deeper bass and fuller sound of the XM5s.","I would say the NC700s have a more balanced sound, with far less low end.","So for me, I prefer the sound quality of the XM5s quite a bit more than the NC700s.Call QualityI use my headphones for work calls several hours a day.","But because of the superior noise cancellation and sound quality, I’m going to be using the Sonys from now on.","And this time, the dual processors are capable of filtering higher frequency sounds, including some voices.","But the over the ear closed design may help dull annoying sounds.A very small cadre of people claim they become nauseous using noise cancelling headphones, and especially the old model XM4s.","This material fits snugly but with less pressure on your ears while still keeping out the external sounds you don’t want to hear.There were a few other design changes – the XM5s aren’t foldable like the XM4s, and there’s a redesigned case that’s collapsible to save room in your bag when you’re wearing your headphones.With up to 30 hours of battery life, you’ll have enough power to travel halfway to the moon in one of Elon Musk’s rockets.","And the speak to chat lives also, where as soon as you start a conversation, Speak-to-Chat automatically stops your music and lets in ambient sound.","And wear detection knows when you take them off.But – how do they sound?Sony has popped new, more rigid, 30mm carbon fiber drivers in the XM5s.","They have more of an audiophile sound profile with slightly more balanced sound, better clarity, and more accurate bass.","TBH that's hard to find in any headphone due to physics.The XM5s support LDAC and spatial 3D audio, whatever that is, and they have also upgraded their Sony Music Studios Edge-AI music algorithm, which somehow magically guesses what musical dynamics were lost during compression and tries to replace that, so everything sounds crisp and clean without losing the bass that’s necessary in most of today’s popular music.I have heard some folks claimed the MX4s sounded “muddy” with some music.","Try that on your Air Pods Max.The big win seems to be a vast improvement in the sound of your voice during phone calls quality.","I wouldn’t rate the “Surround Sound”/360 audio as mind blowing, but it does the job.","That being said, it’s amazing how clear some sounds can be, such as in Call of Duty… or Minecraft.","They may be 200$ more but they are inarguably better sounding with their adaptive EQ.- Not really at any fault of Sony's, but if you use Apple products you can't use the LDAC codec at all.","You are missing out on a better sound quality on Apple, and can only really use LDAC with Android.","When you do the quick ambient sound it’s really good and makes what you need to hear very clear.","I do not regret my purchase at all; these cans produce such rich and full-bodied bass-enhanced sound that I can't leave a room in my house without bringing them with me.. in case I need awesome music for a bit.Funny story..","Sure, ascetically the air max's look nice and they are definitely the \"it-girl\" accessory right now but the quality of sound and the weight/comfort of these truly is just so much better.","For reference, I'm an Asian male with a slightly bigger ears and head.SOUND 5/5I'm really impressed that these produce fuller sound out of box.","My last Bose headphones provide good neutral sound and can be easier on ears but Sony's headphones are much more enjoyable for most songs.ANC 5/5I live in California so most times at home I have a fan blowing at me not 2 feet away.","But as soon as you cover the right ear cup, it switches to ambient sound right away.BATTERY 4/5The device advertises it has 30 hours.","As soon as I play something on one device when there is no sound playing in another, it switches to the active device.","And there is no delay in switching to ambient sound when right ear cup is covered and switching back to whatever mode or ANC when it is uncovered.PORTABILITY 3/5They no longer can be folded and their case is bulkier.","He loves the sound quality,  battery life, the sound quality, ability to block or allow surrounding sound,  the sound quality, the durable feel, the sound quality, the range, and did I mention the sound quality.","I knew these would sound great because I work in A/V and they're very highly regarded.","But wow, I can't believe how amazing they sound: the frequency response and stereo imaging are unlike anything I've heard.","The Bose QC35’s will do that too, but not nearly as much, but the MX5 is quieter and sounds a little better than the Bose QC35’s and 700’s.","Sorry again, Bose.I won't go detail about the sound quality like mid-tone, bass and other stuff because you can just watch review on YouTube.","But I personally like sound on the Bose NC 700 more, just slightly more.For stylish, it looks OK, like an average headphone.","Noise cancellation isn't as great as the AirPods Max and neither transparency, but the sound quality was a little better in my opinion.","Going to these headphones these were much more comfortable for a longer sessions, which to me alone is worth the extra spending on these headphones.They're slightly better sound-wise than the xm4's but it's not anything most people would notice.","As you expect with sony's these are the top tier in terms of immersion in other environments, so much so to a point that I actually had these on at one point during an after-service dinner party just for the noise canceling to muffle out the sound of the music being played, as I had a headache at the time.","Superior sound, easy to use app and overall awesome value.","The headphone is very comfortable and the quality of sound is very clean and sharp","For the price you get a durable, Great sound quality audio device.","I found this to be a huge let down and was even more annoyed I needed these myriad of apps to utilize a huge selling feature of the headphones.Besides the compatibly issue the headphones were amazing: great design, amazing audio, and great battery life yet, ultimately for me it’s overly complicated ways and hoops to jump through as an Apple user is what steered me away here.I instead bought the Apple AirPods Max, equally great sound quality, superior design, and elite performance, plus they are insanely and easily comparable with every thing Apple which was a huge selling point for me.","Amazing sound quality, easy to turn on/off the noise cancellation.","If you only care about sound quality though, you may want to look elsewhere.","My previous daily driver was a pair of Sennheiser HD58x Jubilees (paired with a Qudelix 5k cause rip the headphone jack) and they sounded amazing, arguably better than these headphones at a lower price, that's including the receiver.","You get better battery sure, but for some reason the cans amplify whatever ambient noise is around you and make them very echo-y/muddy and yes, I made sure it wasn't set to the pass through mode) It's almost like you are in a void and it doesn't negatively affect sound quality by a noticeable margin.For whatever reason you can't use the usb cable to pass through audio so your two options are bluetooth and aux.","High frequencies sound like absolute trash through aux and the bass loses its thump.","Not only do they sound great, have great noise canceling, are crystal clear for phone calls, and give solid performance for those late night gaming sessions but they are so light and comfortable you hardly notice that you have them on.","The quality of the music sounds really good but I haven’t used many headphones other than the koss headphones but i love them and do think they sound really good.","The sound quality is awesome though.","If you need more compact headphones, I would recommend the Sennheiser Momentum 3, which also sounds excellent and has a brighter sound signature.","However, its the 700s would also lose the adjustment very easily compared to the MX5s when moving around because they rubbed against a headrest.Noise CancellingI won't focus on the sound quality because I am not an audiophile.","Once sounds stops on one device the second device starts playing right away.","The same button can also turn off/on noise cancelling but rather the headphones given a verbal sentence like \"Noise Cancelling 5\" to let me that I am in ambient sound mode.","I need to learn the sound of 3 different tones.","They’re lightweight, they look nice, the sound quality is nice, and the noise cancellation is amazing.","I use them primarily to listen to vinyl records and the sound is incredible.","You can download the song headphone app to adjust bass treble etc also but I think the balance and brightness of sound is perfect as is.","First, they fit perfectly over my ears and are so comfortableSecond,  The sound quality is awesome.","sound quality is good.3.","Win-win!Out of the box, the sound quality on these cans is decent but the headphones are more bass-heavy.","The low end sounds a little “muddy”.","We'd rather rather live with the just-tolerable sound profile than give up all that information to Sony.","The sound quality is amazing.","The separation and sound staging are quite precise I'd say, and with the app you can have practically unlimited bass while still maintaining crisp, prominent highs, that do not interrupt or drown out the mids.","These headphones are built for every genre of music BECAUSE they're so precise and customizable as far as sound goes.","That's a massive plus, interpreting a song differently because you changed the way it sounded.","The smaller drivers do not in any way take from the sound quality.","They sound like quality headphones, and the volume control is consistent.","The sound quality does not change until about maybe 90-100%.","Your preference in sound can be a lot more precise using these headphones.","Maybe movies..and YouTube..and Game of Thrones..you get the point.The sound quality in these is best described as, adequate...though mostly bordering on dismal.","Almost the exact sound profile as Sony's XB (extra bass) series of headphones.","The treble rolls off too soon, leaving you with a sound best described as \"under a wet blanket\".","Almost all of these features can be had in the 900 and 700 series, for much less money, and roughly the same sound quality.","Heck, even the older XM4's sound roughly the same for WAAAY less money.","No, what I'm pointing out is that for a 1000 series, the best of the best, the highest you can go, the most expensive ANC headphones Sony makes, they should -at least- have drivers in them that sound decent.","The sound is really good, very pleasing to the ears.","But then again, the sound is far superior.","Sound quality was great, noise cancelling was solid, and initially battery life was fantastic.","I need mine to see what I’m working on, and just moving my head around would make a creaking sound very similar to how old floorboards sound.","The sound was punchy and accurate.","Very disappointed to find that neither Sonys top televisions nor Sonys ps5 are natively compatible with these… you’ll need to expect to have to make a separate purchase for wireless dongle(s) for anything other than your cell phone or laptop… alternatively you can wire the wireless headphones, but from my experience, they lose all sound quality when wired direct (ps5 3.5mm)… so if you think you may watch / play ps5 at night while the Mrs is sleeping, what you’ll get is a wire to the ps5 remote and mono-stereo sound… in other words, when using with a ps5 or Sonys top 80/90 series oLED TVs… they’re about as good as a $5.00 pair of headphones from the dollar store… when paired to a phone / laptop they’re excellent… but imo, they’re way way way WAAAAAAYYYYYY overpriced to not be compatible with top end Sony products….",")**edit**Also not compatible with Sony Bluetooth sound barAlso not compatible with low latency dongle(FYI previous versions were low latency codec)Also lacks any IP rating, if you wear these in sunlight and get sweaty, kiss them goodbye","Other than that, the sound quality is not even half of what you get with an airpods pro, big sound leakage, noise cancellation is also similar to airpods pro.","The sound quality and build quality are wonderful.","it looks great, sounds really welll justr needs an eq balance.","Everyone says i sound clear and it picks up so much.","I may have to bring my ANC ear buds, as I don't think I can tolerate these headphones for more than a couple of hours.The sound quality was disappointing to me.","Continues on a bit of a muddy sound like the previous models, however the noise cancelling is superb and EQ options such as the custom Wavelet profile from soundguys make this an incredible all around headphone.Edit: After owning this for a few days I've noticed some issues.","This is likely due to the (probably) low density foam used, and could be detrimental to sound quality in the long term.Edit 3: Accidentally put a little too much force when squeezing these into a bag, the bracket held to the band by a single screw and some adhesive kinda just fell apart.","Much better sounding than my Airpod Max.","The noice cancellation and ambient sounds are top notch.","The sound is the best part.","I suggest using Mogami headphones cable to the get the overall best quality sound.","Better off getting a sound bar or AV receiver for the same price.","Music sounds really good especially if you mess with the EQ.","These sound ok.","Personally like the sound from older Bose 700 model.","Sound and build quality is stellar.","Wanted to upgrade but A/B testing still had my 1000XM2’s feeling and sounding better then these.","The sound quality is outstanding to my ears and I listen to a lot of classical music where it is easy to notice any performance issues.","Callers report hearing me from far away and crackling sound, just like the other Sony modelSony WH-1000XM4.","I really wanted to keep these because the sound is AMAZING.","No more creaking sounds since it doesn't fold, which sucks.","If you, like me, like to wear these headphones just to cancel sound and not play anything, you'll notice the auto ANC working it's magic.","Best pair of ANC headphones I've ever used overall in terms of sound quality, materials used, weight on head and styling.","Sound quality is good but I feel my old Bose QC35’s were just as good and had similar if not better NC.","Great noise canceling and sound, but I would not wear them for a long time because the earcups feel too hot.","Easily the best headphones I have ever owned.Pros:Best sound for the priceNice EQ settings (could be more advanced though)Clean & Modern DesignTop tier ANC (Noice Cancellation) (better than Airpod Max)Cons:Not as portable as XM4'sNot quite as padded as XM4, but still very comfortable to me (this is subjective)Pass through is not quite as good as Airpod Max (but remember ANC is better on XM5s)","Can confirm that the sound is great, noise cancellation is great, but I just could not wear these for more than an hour.","The XM5’s have a much crisper sound, great bass, great mics and are much more comfortable than the XM4’s!","The pressure from the noise cancelling can cause me headaches, so i end up not using it much, the sound quality is good, but my biggest dissapointment is THEY ARE NOT LOUD.","Tried looking up ways to try and make them louder, hooked up the cord to my phone and headphones and the sound quality immediately dropped and they are STILL not loud.","Now i’m stuck with the headphones and trying to figure out a way to get rid of them to get a set that actually encompasses what headphones are supposed to do as far as sound volume and quality.","I have the XM4's and these sound quite a bit different, but not necessarily in a good way.","I'm not sure if mine are defective as I'm not getting the 'sounds better than then XM4' vibes like nearly everyone else.","These, or the XM4's, have no water resistance.Anyway, I will try these with different DAC's and even the new Sony Walkman to see if sound quality gets better.","As far as the muffled sound, maybe there's a break in period.My quick verdict would be to save your money if you already own some XM4's.","Just don't expect the sound to be an upgrade.","PROS-Perfectly Balanced Sound Signature (Subjectively better than XM4)-Hands down one of the best Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) Technology-Lightweight and Comfortable (for X amount of hours)-Excellent Battery LifeCONS-Build Quality feels Cheap and Fragile-Earpads can Deform, get Hot (sweaty), and become Uncomfortable-Flimsy Case-PriceyOh wow!","Sony got the sound signature right this time.","The previous model, Sony WH-1000XM4, has a V-Shaped sound signature (recessed mids with focus on the highs and lows) that is catered towards the general public but the lack of mids just doesn't sound right to my ears.","The latest iteration, Sony WH-1000XM5, has a perfectly tuned sound signature that is balanced throughout the range.","The earpads can also deform which is not ideal as it may affect the sound signature (due to loss of proper seal) and comfort.","The sound quality is just excellent and the noise cancelling is top notch.","I really do enjoy this headphone and am satisfied with its sound performance.","There is storage space for the USB-C Cable to charge them.As far as sound quality, I think these sound a bit better than the previous generation.","Everything is a bit more detailed and generally \"tighter\" sounding on these.","Everything was bright and crisp and voice sounded very clear.","I've been very impressed with the audio quality so far.Noise Cancellation is good, but considering the use the same sensor as the last generation (XM4's had a single processor for this, XM5's have 2 of that same sensor), I was expecting a lot more sound to be canceled out.","There is some minor discomfort with the head band as some have noted but I found I got used to it quick and it doesn’t really bother me.Both headphones sound excellent for movies, tv shows and YouTube and I doubt I could tell them apart in their basic settings.","The AirPods make it sound like the voices and effects are coming from the screen and surrounding you.","In comparison the sound from the Sonys are localizable from the drivers.","The voices come direct to your ears from the drivers which doesn’t sound as good and can take me out of whatever I’m watching.","Sound wise I prefer the AirPods bc of the spatial audio.","Without a good ANC, I will not be able to hear the sound clearly unless I turn up the volume all the way up.","I am not sure who wins here.Sound Quality:Some instruments, especially Guitar, sounded natural and amazing on Momentum 4.","But not every instrument sounded great.","Now some instruments like Drum sounded better on Sony XM5.","I will deduct one point for Sony XM5 here.Sound Stage :This was my main deciding factor.","When listening to music overall, Sony XM5s sounded lively and immersive.","Momentums on the other hand sounded flat and boring.","For me Sony XM5 won here.Equalizer & App:I liked Sony App and Equalizer much better.Sound Quality on Higher Volume:Increasing the volume on Momentum 4, flatten the sound.","On Sony XM5, the sound quality remained the same on any volume.Final Verdict:I decided to keep Sony XM5 and returned Sennheiser Momentum 4.","I also compared with the Bose Quiet Comfort 35, and 700 headphones, and Apple's AirPods Max.I sampled many types of music from CDs directly through a high-quality Sony Blu-ray disc player with a wire, then repeated with Bluetooth 5.0 using iTunes with ALAC Lossless without external amplification, and Amazon Music on the highest quality settings.Sony's DSEE Extreme is impressive at upscaling compressed digital files and seems to make even old MP3s sound better.","Perhaps it is just my ear, but the brilliance of the sound playing classical, jazz, and classic rock is slightly below my expectations.","I understand that these are not audiophile headphones, but at the $399 price point, they should have a \"music\" or \"movie\" capability or setting to reveal the vividness and \"color\" of the original recording.If you read the technical specifications, it appears that Sony is aiming toward a reference or studio quality; the pure flat sound without any \"juicing.\"","Sometimes, the extra sound stage is desirable, though often it allows the listener to hear the mixing choices made in the recording studio, even the flaws.","For music, where the quality of sound really is the point of the experience, I will use other headphones, including the WH-1000XM4 and the excellent WF-1000XM4 \"True Wireless\" in-ear buds.These are purely my opinions.","Sound quality is great.","I tried the Bose from a less expensive to the most expensive and to be honest The Sony WH-1000XM series, from XM2 through the latest XM5's are the hands down absolute best from noise cancelling, sound quality and comfort.","I sometimes even wear them to sleep, though I wouldn't recommend that.Noise cancellation and sound quality: these definitely seem to be a notable improvement in noise cancellation over my previous XM3s, and with similar NC but better sound quality, compared to the XM4.","You have more options than with previous models to customise your sounds and buttons -- one feature that's easy to miss: if you keep accidentally getting into speak-to-chat mode, you can turn it off easily by pressing on the right headphone cup with two fingers and holding until you hear it disengage (much easier than turning it off in the app every time).","Top notch sound quality, companion app is actually useful, battery life for days and comfortable enough that you can actually wear them for hours on end.","But the sound itself is first-rate, with a well-rounded and enveloping sound that's great for music of all kinds, and movies too.","You certainly can't fault them on sound, noise cancellation, or convenience.","The sound quality is great, but every so often it disconnects from my computer.","Yes they sound great.","The “I turned on” and “I turned off” sounds are distinct but I could not write down how to tell them apart (even if I knew) from the similar pleasant chimes for “ANC on/off” or “Bluetooth paired / disconnected”.","Best sounding headphones I’ve ever used with the best noise cancellation.","I also tried the Bose 700’s, which sound great but the noise cancellation has a weird vacuum effect…the XM5s don’t have that.","If you are an audiophile and really appreciate how your music sounds all the time these are changing the games.","Even the mdr-v6, or the newer version 7506, are great options with 40mm drivers.The sound on these BT headphones is good, and the battery technology is great.","Hence, Sony making a $400 30mm headphone.Get a decent new or used Home Theater amp, and some good corded headphones, and hear real sound.","Even FM radio will sound dynamic.","$400 buys you some awesome old school super sound.","Sound quality, noise cancellation, and comfort are all amazing.","The sound quality is where this shines.","For meetings and phone calls, he has clear and crisp sound, no background noise, and has no muffling or crackling sounds.","He can block out sound or just minimize the volume.","They sound better, they mute better, they last longer, and you can wear them for hours without discomfort.","The sound quality is SUPERB.","These are light weight - which is something I will admit they have an edge over the AirPods Max on (those are on the heavy side)I tested these with a variety of music to check tones, bass, and overall sound quality.","Sound quality is top notch as always.","Good sound quality.","Good :Active noise cancellation is fantastic!Fast charging is good, bluetooth connectivity is fine!The call quality is amazing.The app shows the SPL levels and it's effects on hearing which is awesome!Bad :360Reality Audio is a gimmick, should've had AptX HD, AptX Adoptive along with LDAC because with LDAC you cannot connect two devices at once.The outer plastic cladding near the foam pads push the frames and makes it a bit uncomfortable (those with specs are better off with XM4).Ugly:The sound quality is good when you don't EQ , but if you use their own apps EQ it's good only upto 70% once you increase the volume beyond it starts to distort and once you turn it all the way up the EQ just flatens and sounds like hot garbage.I don't hear beyond 60-70% volume but even if i want the volume to go to max the SPL doesn't go beyond 99db with any codec I've tried LDAC, AAC, SBC with their upscaler DSEE Extreme no change whatsoever.Also the change in volume beyond 70-75% is really not much and infact the headphones only start to distort!","Absolutely dulls the sounds down and I actually fell asleep with how quiet my surroundings were.","The sound quality is absolutely horrible compared to other headphones I've listened to.","The volume also doesn't get high enough in my opinion; also the higher you turn the volume the less \"full\" sounding the music is if listening to songs, especially if you have custom settings on the equalizer (makes it sound cheap).","Seriously Sony who thought of the no folding design?While they're very light and comfy, have great noise cancelling for certain frequencies, contain amazing call quality, have 30-40 hrs of battery and the touch sensors on the right ear cup are SUPER fun and easy to use, I would not buy these if you're also expecting great sound.","The surround sound is a gimmicky feature.","Sony should partner with at least a few major movie/song streaming websites to support surround sound experience.","The sound quality out of the box is not good for what you pay.","In teams call on windows, it makes a lot of hissing sound even when everyone is on mute.8.","The swivel on two earcups have a plastic feel and do make creeky sounds often.10.","Honestly, if you try xm4 or xm3, they will provide comparable experience and better experience in sound.","Sound quality is certainly different, but I wouldn’t go as far as to say it’s better.","Sound quality is great but physically poor build, it broke after 6 months of owning it, Sony doesn’t cover physical damage on warranty so be you’ll have to baby these the whole time you own them.","I like the sound quality and noise cancellation.","!I am amazed and have recommend them to multiple people.They are quite pricey but honestly with this sound quality and this ability to be able to blockout almost all noise is incredible a whole new experience these are worth it if you have the money!","The sound quality is very refined.","I don't hear any weird noise sounds when moving or air puffiness in my ear.","This is my favorite one by far.I travel a lot and mostly use these when travelling, for conference calls on the fly, music, tv shows, noise reduction on the plane and so on and it’s simply perfect in all these aspects:- Sound quality is very impressive- Noise cancelling is top of the field- Voice clarity for the microphone on my calls is perfect for my coworkers- Syncing is a breeze- Controls are easy to get a handle onVery very satisfied with this acquisition.","The surround sound is amazing and it's very clear without having to put the volume too high.All electronics by \"Sony\" never seem to disappoint.","PROS:Fantastic ANC (utilizes 8 microphones)Paired much easier and quicker than any other BT headphones I’ve triedLouder volume than any other BT headphones I’ve triedOutstanding sound qualityGreat control and features within the AppVery responsive and intuitive touch controls - I raised the volume by correctly guessing to swipe up on the right ear cup.Love the case with a magnetic closure inside that stores charge cable etc.Very happy that they have included the option to use as wired headphonesAmazing battery life (up to 30 hours) with quick charge options (3 minute charge with a USB-PD compatible charger gives 3 hours of use)Can be paired with 2 bluetooth devices at the same timeGood adjustments can be made for a comfortable fitVery lightweight for their sizeCONS:My ears were sweating a bit after prolonged use…could be more comfortable","The mic quality has improved significantly, making voices sound more realistic, and the sound quality sees a reduction in the bass and increase in the treble to make music sound more neutral.","Furthermore, with cheap wired and wireless IEMs providing better sound at lower prices than ever before, wireless noise-cancelling over-ears have become stagnant (in terms of technology, competition, and price) that the value of such a product is questionable.","What do I talk about the insulation for the annoying sound in the background, or the sound you hear like magic?","This headset is really great worth buying because the music comes out like magic Isolation is very cool and comfortable Do not be alarmed  The thing that amazed me is the battery, the sound and the insulation well.","When you turn on the loud sound, you feel like you are in front of a singer or singer.","Great sound quality and noise cancellation.","After several hours my ears are not hot but the pressure is a bit higher than I would have preferred to set.Sound: sounds quality is excellent and follows Sony's typical tuning, great mid ranges and softer on the bass, clarity is second to none.","( despite an equalizer that is present)ANC: Sony's ANC is quite powerful and I am impressed with the amount of sound if blocks out.","Music sounds great.","I don't have somewhere to hang them at work, or in my locker, and the case is one more thing to have to carry and open for security.I know it sounds minor, but after 3 months, it added up, and I went back to my old pair.","PROS:- new design is lightweight and comfortable- headband is comfortable- touch controls are great and intuitive- auto speak works great- App allows fine tuning and settings- case is solid and slim- ANC is superb- sound is top notch!CONS:- matte finish will grab your fingerprintsI have sampled several of Sony's previous generations of the 1000XM series and though they were great in both sound and ANC performance, I wasn't won over by the fit and feel of the past generations.","My only gripe is that the cups have a matte finish which is a fingerprint magnet if you aren’t careful.Sound:  Sony headphones have always had a great soundscape.","Just go into the app and adjust the sound as needed.","I have been able to crank up the volume on several genres of music and the sound never distorts or gets muffled in high output.","I prefer a more balanced sound and with closed earcups you’ll appreciate less bass over time.ANC: this is where things get exciting!","Summary:Very good noise cancellingTop notch sound performanceExcellent Bluetooth connectivityMore expensive than similar competitors, and even Sony’s previous generation XM4Does not fold into a compact shapeThe recently released Sony WH-1000XM5 (from now on I’ll just refer to them as the “XM5”) is the latest set of noise cancelling wireless headphones from Sony, building on the success of the previous model, the XM4.","Although the earcup padding seals out external sound fairly well, the headphones let you hear your own voice clearly by feeding it through the headphones.The noise cancelling works best on low frequency sounds, as is common with most NC headphones.","Traffic sounds, aircraft sounds and machinery were filtered out well.","If you don’t put the headphones back on after a few minutes, the headphones will shut off.Another feature is useful when you want to briefly hear ambient sounds, such as a PA announcement or similar.","Cupping your hand over the right earcup will pause playback and feed in ambient sound.","It also monitors your listening habits and can warn you to limit your volume to prevent hearing loss.Now to the most important aspect of these headphones – sound quality.","These are by far the best sounding wireless headphones I have ever heard, and they match up well to premium wired headphones.","Simply amazing!These headphones sounded great with conventional sources such as Spotify or 320kbps mp3s.","The demo on their web site sounded absolutely mesmerizing.","Sound is great, features and noise cancellation above mu expectations","The headphones are perfect, with phenomenal noise cancellation, great sound quality and very comfortable.","No need to comment on sound quality, Sonys are always top tier.","The volume on these things are super low a cheap sound quality compared to beats..","Amazing sound quality, great bass (make sure you get the headphones app).","These do not sound any better than any other &50-$100 headphones.","Sound quality - bass heavy out of the box, but the equalizer in the app can bring the sound profile back to neutral quite easily.","Sound quality is great and the headphones are light and comfortable for long listening sessions.","I hadn't realized how much sound my refrigerator made until I got this.I have WF-1000XM3(the older ear buds) which supposedly have great noise cancelling, and having used them I can confirm they do that part well enough.","The sound quality is clear.","Expect high bass because this is closed back, but again you can't have good sound isolation otherwise.","Noise cancellation is better than any I’ve tried and I work with high velocity dryers that are 108 DB and they just sound like wind in the distance.","The sound is perfection","The sound quality is FANTASTIC!","I tried using it to stream once instead of my gaming headset for my pc but it wasn't as capable with the microphone and getting where the sound was coming from.","Love these - amazing noise cancelling features, the sound quality is great and they're perfect for my very loud work environment.","If I have to give full mark, I will give it for noise cancellation(10/10) ,sound quality is also good as well as Bluetooth connectivity.","Have the 1000MX4 also, though with several tech support calls over the year about digital sounds (son had a pair that was not making the sounds streaming from the same device)I finally gave up and just bought the next generation.","Wasted over $450 on the MX4, thought I would just get a replacement set mailed to me after a number times reporting that they just were not working as intended.MX4 vs MX5Cons:-Don't fold up as nicely as the MX4 do-Don't have the same audio alerts (power on/off) that I found useful on the MX4-Not quite as comfortable as the MX4Pros:-Haven't heard the digital sounds using the same devices-Have a slightly nicer appearance compared to MX4","Very effective, perfect noise cancellation, great sound quality and battery lasts forever.","I'm sure you have seen raving reviews of the product all over the internet, I too was convinced this might just be the best product for me, and so, I ordered these headphones without having an in-store sound test, something which I never do as a rule.","Should've stuck to my rule, these sound worse than my KZ ZSN Pro Xs, and those are an entry level iems!","Sound was muddy which as a treble lover completely disgusted me (seriously, you can listen to the extremely minute vibrations of the guitar strums in la vie róse with good treble but all that detail is just lost on these) but usually in such cases the bass compensates, but even in that regard this product is underwhelming, the heart thumping bass just isn't there, you expect an impact on the drop and get a muzzled thwomp instead, which is sooo frustrating, just leaves you unsatisfied at what should be the climax of the composition.I have tried updating the drivers, retuning using wavelet, used my trusty IFI ZEN and fiddled with the bass bost for hours on end and yet am completely puzzled as to how so many people rate these so high.","I use these headphones both on Bluetooth to my phone and wired at my desk plugged into an analog music source.I use the ANC in all use cases, and it's really good for mitigating distractions.I have avoided the smartphone app and higher-level configurations as for now I just need headphones to be headphones.Wired Analog; ANC is optional when wired, and a full charge lasts for 20-24 hours of constant play.Wired USB; works well, and of course charges at the same timeBlueTooth; Of course not as rich as an analog source, but still sounds great, and when using as a 2-way headset I'm quite impressed at the sound quality and noise-rejection on both ends.Callers on the other end of a BT call report very solid sound quality on my voice.Runtime per charge is reduced somewhat while on BT, I'd guess something like 10-12 hoursComfort;Spring compression is about right to balance between comfort and sealing.It would be nice if the pad stuffing was a bit more resilient, as on the head the pads compress until my ears are in contact with the speaker grid and that can get uncomfortable after an hour or so.CONS;The ANC does not time out when there's no signal, which has left me several times with a dead battery when I've been interrupted, taken them off and forgotten to power down the headphones.One other \"feature\" that i don't really care for is that speaking aloud while ANC is on cancels the ANC and mutes the source until you manually flip it back on again.","You may only hear very high pitched noises like horns or high revving motorcycles if they're close by.Sound quality is good too.","The VA will guide you on the further steps)- The Noise Cancelling (Bummer), The sound (Play the 360 Spatial Audio video on YT)- Volume at 60% should be enough for most people to enjoy the music.- Extremely comfortable to wear for long durations and these charge really fast.- The Bluetooth range is good enough to roam around a duplex without worrying about fades.- The app gives enough customizability freedom.","Powerful bass and very rich sound.","Superior sound quality, you can customize your EQ, and the ANC is amazing.","Sound better than my Bose and the noise cancelling is great.","The sound quality is amazing.","You can adjust and set different sound profiles for whatever you are listening to.The headphones are very comfortable, and I usually hate wearing headphones.","You can also set ANC to ambient sounds and ask it to emphasize voices, so you can hear people but not noise.","I wish they were on the left.The headphones do work out of the box without the app, but app lets you adjust the settings and get the most of them.I love the headphones, they sound so good","But it’s sooooooooo annoying.XM2 was far better in noise cancellation.And the sound quality?","XM2 had a clearer sound.","And I can totally hear the sound getting distorted on higher peaks.","Fortunately (or unfortunately for my pocket…) I own way too many headphones and can speak from experience using them everyday.- These can’t fold into a compact, easy-to-store size like it’s gen 4 predecessor or QC45.- Sound is muffled and far less clear than AirPod Max.- Unlike QC45, all controls are touch-based so get triggered even if you gently brush your head against curtains for example.I’m debating returning these honestly","They sound bad, feel worse than Bose headphones, and this pair had obviously already been bought by someone and returned, the package was not new and they had been paired to another phone already","They are too expensive simply because their sound quality is .. so so.","They have this extra 360 reality audio feature that they showcase briefly during setup... and that stuff sounded really good.","The sound quality just is a big disappointment.","Only for the sound quality.","Honestly, I have a pair of ankers that I think are as good sound quality, and they were a lot cheaper.","Sound wise they sound flat out fantastic in every genre of music.","Highs and vocals come though clean and clear and at max volume there is zero distortion or sound quality issues and the range is pretty incredible.","I'm no sound expert but one of the biggest factors that I've found in how to really get the best represented sound quality is to have a decent equalizer supported app or controllability and on that score Sony delivers.","In their app it is easy to navigate and the app has a ton of options to tweak and fine tune sound quality and performance.","Very comfy, the sound is incredible, and noise cancelation is from another world.","Sony is listening, the XM5 now has a more balance sound, more flat on the EQ.","The sound stage is more wider than XM4, the mids and highs are now more pronounce but not bright.","Noise cancelling is better than the XM$ at eliminating sound I used to get on the XM4 You'll get the same battery life as the XM4 also.","The sound quality is amazing and I can't wait to use these on my next flight.","Still love the sound.","Wide variety of sounds that become new with every upgrade.","The sound quality is great as always.","Sound is not noticeably better than a regular built in computer speaker.","They sound amazing, they look amazing, the ANC is amazing...ect...Just don't fit me well.","The sound is nice and the sound cancelling is decent.","Sound quality is good.","I like the sound quality of the xb950's but the noise canceling is so good it makes up for the lower sound output","Honestly I am not sure, the calls sound like I amI’m a tin can.","Lacking in sound too","The sound is great and noise canceling is a plus.","These headphones are amazing and sound so awesome.","I also tested them against a white noise machine that was 50 feet away, and they failed to block out this steady sound, even with music playing at a comfortable volume.End of Nov 2022, and end of the headphonesI contacted Sony through chat, and they had me reset them.","The headphones continued to turn on/off the music, and turn on/off the level of sound control.","I Love Sony products this would have been my 3rd pair of wireless from Sony..had to return them …Kick drum sounded synthetic poor bass response and this was after hours of adjusting EQ ..I think the driver is just to small 30MM…it’s a drag writing a poor review and I don’t like returning stuff","The headphones are simply amazing from sound, comfort and amazing ANC.","The sound is much improved from the XM4 but is still not where I would like it to be.","Using these in wired mode makes them sound horrible so that’s not a feature worth mentioning.","Noice cancelation, sound quality, weight, comfort, you name it the mark V comes out on top.","If you like squeeze plastic bag sound, this headset is your perfect choice!","muddy in lows and decent but not great soundstage.","These try hard and the noise cancellation is great, but the 360 sound is weak and just off..I got them for work, but the mics and connection did not do well with the limited use I did.Not bumming!The warning says no sweating lol, no problem these will fall of your head well before a sweat is broken, annoying.","First let’s start of by saying I’m seeing so many positive reviews by people who never owned the xm4 or previous models they sound like promo reviews by SONY if you ask me, so you can understand the frustration by people who have owned previous models, first let’s start with noise cancellation which is awful on the xm5 no manual adjustments to the noise cancellation, and the auto noise cancellation optimization is a zonk on this generation Sony you took something so simple and nice and just messed it up, taking phone calls with these headphones were great and battery life is always awesome with the XM LINEUP,  now let’s start with the clamping force on this one I find myself having to lift the headphones off of my head because the feeling is so tight never had an issue with the XM4, the build quality on this one feels okay and the touch controls are much faster and responsive on this generation, the ability to not fold on this generation is a zonk to me as well but it looks like Sony is going in this direction so this would have some getting used to as they are following the other competitors with their designs as well, sound quality is great not excellent as everyone has their own methods and ideas as to what good sounding headphones are, until the noise cancellation is fixed, clamping force and more comfortable pads I don’t see the reason to try to like these headphones because they are the newest thing out, these manufacturers are putting out junk and not ready products at the cost of my wallet","The only good thing is the noise cancelation other than that the sound quality is mediocre.","The sound is clear and the noise cancellation is on top.","No one ever claimed they sounded good, but the ANC was unparalleled.","With the Sony WH-1000XM5 you get reasonably crisp audio, good sound stage, and excellent ANC.","The phone call quality is much better and I personally think the sound is better but not by much.","The sound is amazing.","I've been using XM3 for about 4 years now.I skipped XM4 as I heard it's not much better than XM3.As for XM5, as I heard it's got phenomenal features, so I wanted to give it a try.For sound quality, it is definitely alot better than XM3-Its directional sound is noticeably better than that of XM3,And music/movies/games just sound so much better.Some of the really cool feature it's got are speak to chat and multiple connection features.Speak to chat allows me to talk to someone freely without taking off the headphones.Multiple connection feature allows me to switch from my PC to my phone instantly when I get a call, or play a video on my phone.As for noise cancelling, XM3 seems to have better ANC.I thought I was able to hear more noises when wearing XM5, but it didn't seem that far off.My biggest disappointment was its comfort.Due to playing video games on a daily basis for long time, I sometimes wear the headphones for 8~12 hours.","sound, noise control are awesome when doing homework.","the sound quality isn’t mindblowing at first but tweaking the equalizer in the app should fix this.i’ve never owned a pair of noise canceling headphones before, but to me the noise canceling is very solid.","They sound AMAZING (Sony's rich and full sound is unmatched).They are SUPER lightweightThe noise cancelling is BETTER than the Apple Airpods max headphonesVery nice travel caseThe only reason I returned them is even on their smallest adjustable setting they were too big for my normal sized head.","There is a bug that if you move them the wrong way and unable to figure out the exact movement that you loose sound and require a full on and off the return to normal function","Sometimes i am hearing an odd sound on the right side of the headphones.","My friend had the QC 35 II and the sound was kinda lifeless tbh.","The sound quality on these are amazing and you can adjust what you want with the EQ.","These are just fine as mentioned before the sound quality is just great to me(I'm not an audiophile).Build quality 10/10Sound quality 10/10.","(Only thing I heard that sounded bad from a different person was wired but I don't plan on using these wired.","When crossing a street, one can either push a button for ambient sound or simply cup a hand over the right ear to temporarily activate ambient sound.The swipe controls (volume increase / decrease and forward / back for tracks) make this pair of headphones easier to operate than any other pair of headphones I have.","No need to look away to handle my music or podcasts, which is quite helpful.While on the train, passengers' sounds fade away, allowing me to focus on whatever I'm listening to or watching.","Pricey but incredible sound, great noise cancellation and comfortable to wear.Only drawback is they don’t fold down like the previous Sony headphone models.","Initially I did not like how they sounded so thankfully the app has an EQ that you can use to change the sound.","I have never spent more than $120 on earphones/headphones, but I wanted to know what \"expensive\" headphones would sound like.","This was a tremendous change and I am now satisfied with the volume.The bass on these headphones are great, but I like deeper bass, to where it should sound muddled, so these did not meet my expectations.","The \"see through\" mode (hear through) amplifies the sounds around you so you can hear them while you listen to music, but if your music volume is above 40%, you still won't hear anything from the outside, unless it's very loud.The headphones (with the app) come with a cool feature where they stop playback and enable the \"hear-through\" mode so that you can talk to people without having to either take off the headphones or stop your music.","I've had them for eight months or so now and wish i had gone with something else.Pros: Good sound, comfortable when wearing.Cons: Auto-shut off, difficult to maneuver for one-ear listening.I've found that maybe I'm weird, but I often like to free an ear to listen to the room rather than the headphones.","This sounds like a feature but it acts like a bug.","First time buyer for anything involving SonyI’m not disappointed at all, if your on the fence about these please get this head set the Bluetooth is instant on any device, if you want more bass learn how to use the EQ settings and they can give you some really nice sounds, the adaptive sound feature is great, anytime I go into a new room it’s analyzing it and adjusting properlyBottom line get this headset","But the sound quality and noise cancellation is perfect for my school trips so I’ll be keeping them.","Very Musical, balanced sound.","The volume could be one setting louder, the noise cancelation 15 % better, but the sound quality and comfort makes these a great fit.","There are a number of recommended Apps for these to enhance the sound experience, but these all have $$ subscriptions and in App purchases.","The sound is crisp and you can suit it to fit your personal listening preferences.","With its industry leading noise cancelation system, you can enjoy high quality sound from  Bluetooth or enjoy the headphone's full frequency range of an astounding, 4 hz to 40k hz,  with its 3.5mm, wired connection option, while still being able to experience the sounds of the world around you.Either way, you get a wide sound pallet, from deep punchy base to crisp highs anda well defined midrange.The available software found on the Sony website, allows you to fully customize the way sound is reproduced by the large 30mm, soft edged drivers, giving you full control over how you enjoy, music, movies, dialog and much more.In my opinion, these headphones compare favorably against other more expensive premium name brand, noise canceling headphones available today.","There are probably cheaper headphones that have better sound quality from other less mainstream brands but the anc is the main selling point","Sound quality rivals Bose which should be expected for the price.","The sound quality was good.","Not to mention that, as a musician, the Bose QC series feature a flat(ter) sound profile which I prefer more.","The sound quality, features, comfort, and price (well, for the under $500 price point) are unmatched to anything that I’ve ever experienced.Plenty of bass, treble, and midrange for anything that I listen to, with nice functional features like when my wife wants to have a quick conversation (I just hold my hand over the right side of the ear pad and the volume turns low) or if I want to say something without taking the headphones off, it’ll just pause whatever is playing, are nice little features.I’m sure that there are other over the ear headphones out there that are superior, but nothing that I’ve found at this price point.","Bought these for work and I am distracted 99% less of the time with co-worker talk.I tried these out once for home(gaming PC use) and the sound was garbage.","Sound quality is a little better, the sliders that commonly broke on the previous models are a different style now so I think they will last much longer.","These feel great and look great, my only (minor) complaint so far is they no longer tell you \"power off\" when you turn them off and they no longer tell you \"noise canceling\" or \"ambient sound\" when you switch between modes, they just have a series of beeps you have to memorize.","These are the best headphones on the market the  noise cancelling and sound is amazing.","Sound quality is good but I do wish they went louder because I like my music LOUD.","The sound quality was less than I had expected.I ended up buying Sennheiser Momentum 4's.","They were less expensive and had better overall sound than the Sony WH1000XM-5s.","To test the noise cancellation I turned the sound on about 1/3 volume and my dad spoke to me and I could not hear him.","I see that LDAC noticeably improves the sound quality (atleast to my ears) and overall I am happy with the performance.I own bang and Olufsen H9i but I needed something for taking calls, listening music and travel.","Though bang and Olufsen checks sound part but it is not portable and gets heavy on after 30 mins of wearing.","This headphone NC and sound is at par with the Bose 700 but consider that the  700s was release in 2019, Sony still some ways to go and definitely not worth the asking price.","Very comfortable, great sound, love them.","I only notice because I have XM5 as smallest setting possible and it fits me, where as with XM3/XM4 I had them a few notches bigger.Sound from XM5 is not noticabely better as far as I can tell.Its honestly hard for me to think of anything XM5 do better than XM4.","Besides some high frequency sounds, the headphone was able to cancel out over 95% the noises.","The remaining 5% are all higher frequency sounds but those can be ignored very easily.Now I’m not an audiophile so I can’t really comment on how it sounds, but it sounds good enough for me.","My son and I have auditory processing disorders, so the noise gets unbearable.We use these, even without sound it has saved us alot of pain, it's a relief to put them on,and be able to sit in a quiet head.","Sound quality was dog s***.","Pardon my French, but it sounded so so bad.","I thought by buying 400 USD headphones I would be blown away.Noise cancelling is nice, but, audio is as good as my 40 and 80 USD headphones from SoundCore and TaoTronics.Noise cancelling might be a little better, but definitely not worth spending 5-10 times what I had with my other headphones.I travel a lot so I thought, I'll pay a premium price to ensure I minimize any outside noise when on a plane or a bus, but it has come with a lot of problems.It pairs with my Win 10 computer, but, audio dissapears every now and then and I have to connect and disconnect.Would definitely return the product if I could, I'm overseas and these are headphones are trouble makers.","The XM5’s (even with adaptive sound control off), seems to toggle the noise cancelation up and down in different environments instead of just keeping the noise cancellation at high.","Absolutely amazing sound.","Sound is nice I like how the app lets you adjust the sound with preset mods and your own customizable mod.","The mics too are nice they sound good in videos, audio messages, and on phone calls.","Much lighter then Apple, and just as good in sound.","The second thing is that if you use them with speed outside (running, really windy out, or a bus/car window is open) then the wind will fill up the noise cancelling sensors and cause some pretty loud and odd sounds.","entirely disappointed in overall sound quality and the features stop at noise cancellation.","Otherwise they have great sound quality, comfort and noise cancelation.","But they fixed that with these.They also sound better than the XM4's.","Both still deliver a pretty smooth, warm sound signature that is not fatiguing for long listening sessions.Also the color is better.","I've tried to love them for a year and a half, but I can't because they have a sound as cold as the metal they are made from.","And Apple being Apple, they did not give you an app to EQ the sound to your liking like Sony does.","You can use some accessibility features to slightly change the sound but this introduces white noise and is just a poor excuse for EQ.","I have always upgraded my cars speakers and added subwoofers, had a sound bar and sub at home etc.","I like a full range, crisp clear sound that works for all types of music.","These headphones are the BEST SOUND I have ever heard out of a speaker.","If you love music and want life changing sound I highly recommend these.","They are super comfortable with or without glasses, sound amazing and battery life is superb.","The noise cancellation is excellent and the sound quality especially when u listen to music it is totally worth buying.","I travel for work, take a lot of planes and talk on the phone and work in industrial environment where noise level goes to over 95db... After losing two sets of earbuds in airport (200$) decided I am not good with small items (dropped box once on an airplane, had to wait for entire plane to leave to look for one of the buds lol it rolled 5 seats ahead, laughed at the time, luckily overlay was 4 hours.After losing 200$ worth of earbuds I've decided it was enough and started researching Bluetooth over ear headphones, from my experience Sony made very good headphones (first pair i bought 20 years ago) in fact i think Sony makes the best sounding portable speakers and headphones, but it is my own opinion.I got these headphones and kept them in package to do more research online and watch more reviews and what I've found that these headphone made sense.","Sound quality is fantastic as well, i enjoy quality sound, own a pair of Beyerdynamic 770dt 80ohm and these Sonies  are just as enjoyable to listen, maybe lag behind the Beyers with quality of sounds, but still sound incredible and I don't have to carry a portable amp to listen to them lolbattery life is another feature that I'm amazed with, listened all day and didn't discharge, i cant say i listened for 30 hours without charge yet, simply because i don't want to run out of battery while I'm listening to an audiobook in an industrial facility, but 10 hours at a time they lasted no problem.","My previous Bose soundsport's were better at such decisions.Sound quality (music): I can say there's a small degradation in sound quality since XM1.","While the XM1 had great sound across most frequencies, these (XM5s) are more bass heavy and light on mids and trebles.","I haven't played with the EQ enough yet so maybe this is fixable.Sound quality (calls): Much improved microphones as compared to XM1s.","It is fine, in every aspect, the sound quality and battery life is just a step ahead from its previously generation.The fit and the comfort though, is just bad for me personally, I struggle to wear this continuously for more than an hour, that’s where it’s really disappointing.","Primary job of this headphone is to sound good.","But it has a very Average sound for the price.","The sound quality is no doubt amazing and I heardparts of songs I had never heard before but I could not take any calls while working and had to go through the whole process of either disconnecting Bluetooth or holding the phone Infront of my face.","Now I can hear enough ambient sound to be aware of what's going on around me without it intruding on what I'm listening to.","It would be better if the blue light stayed lit when on.Sound quality is very good IMO, though I have limited experience with high end headphones.","The quality of sound is very good.","Also, one of its best features is that it detects your movement and adjusts your setting accordingly, which we can choose from ambient sound, noise cancelling.","The sound is pretty epic in comparison to the 3s, the low end is more detailed and defined this time around.The mids and highs are present and not at all muddy.The call quality with the extra mics is amazing, it also cancels the background noise very well.Also, the new design is great, no creaking with this design.","If you're coming from XM3s or earlier, or you are in the market for great-sounding headphones these work amazingly well.","Superb surround and crisp sound.","Need to check few more sound quality","When you use it with your phone it sounds tinny and echos trying to switch back to the TV I have to re pair it every time I would return it if it wasn’t so difficult to return product on line","Great noise cancellation, sound and comfort, better than XM4.","To my surprise they sounded worse.","Sounds blurry at first.","I was debating between the xm4 and the xm5 but I decided to get these ones because I heard these have a better sound quality.","In a nutshell, the sound of these cans isn't working for me.","Sound pressure/ dB warning is amazing for protecting your ears3.","Overall sound quality is pretty good, but super similar to these other two","I've tried many headphones over the years, had an older model which I still love but I decided to try these.I highly recommend these to anyone, don't let the price put you off, you get your money's worth with the quality,  sound and anc.Nice work on eco packaging too Sony.Beautiful case to keep them in too.So happy with this investment!","It creates a muddy sound.","Absolutely amazing sound quality.","It is like the headphones went into a power-save mode or something, but randomly, since the period was not always the same, don't get me wrong, I love the sound, and the Noice Canceling is just the best.","This review was written on May 31, 2022PROS:The sound quality and battery life are absolutely amazing.","To put into perspective what is happening kinda, i put on a constant sound at 60-140hz and try my AirPods, I hear nothing.","I repeated this test multiple times along with a real world test with wind and people talking and the xm5’s, even after giving them time to adjust their adaptive ANC, were performing significantly worse than the same product 2 generations old, and my AirPods maxes.Conclusion: The headphones are really good, sound quality is unmatched by any other Bluetooth headset, and in general, the most optimal combination of everything you could ask for in a daily use headphone.","Sound is a little better and features like N/C are improved.","Sound quality 👌 👏 🙌 👍Noice canceling greatTouch control interactiveCall quality I shocked 😲World best noice canceling and call 📞 quality and sound quality all in one headphonesOverall no waste of moneyJust buy u r music 🎶 lover","When on VCs, it has a strange tinny sound, like I'm talking across a distance through a metallic instrument...Would I buy this again: NoWhy am I not returning it?","I expected lot wider sound stage from XM5.3.","But Not the Best in terms Sound Quality, Sound Stage I would say.","I use it at work to pair my cellphone for music and my work phone for calls.Microphone is crystal clearHeadphones app is good to adjust settings and sound options.Beautiful case that comes with it where you can store the headphones and there's a little place to put the wires.Cons:Easy to leave grease stain on it because of the mat color (for the black ones).Charging USB cord is wayyyy too short (like 4 inches).They don't fold ( I personally don't mind).","Sound quality is great and the noise cancelling is some of the best I’ve tried.","While anxiously awaiting delivery, I watched every YouTube unboxing and review and was super excited for the supposed best in class ANC and sound.Unfortunately, my experience did not match all of the youtubers.","Finally, the ear cups are so large — almost comedically large — that these really don’t look so great on your head.That being said, the sound quality was very nice.","All genres of music sounded great.The real disappointing thing for me was the ANC.","The poor fit offers very little PASSIVE noise cancelation, which is really a key component of keeping the sound out.","Amazing fit, premium build quality, great ANC, and surprisingly fun sound.","Sure they lack some of the cool extra features of the XM5s like speak to chat, auto pause when removing the cans etc…but who cares if they can’t keep the sound out (for me at least).So in conclusion, if you don’t have a huge head and want a more premium feeling pair of headphones that just do what they’re supposed to do very well, I’d recommend the 700s.","My understanding is that ANC headphones are supposed to cancel continuous sounds and these things are continuous sounds imo.","Sound quality was good, but not game changing (coming from AKG Y500).Next, when I would remove headphones from my head (or ears) and put them back, everything other than the power button would stop working.","But based on the aforementioned experience, I returned.I was able to find a great deal on SoundCore ANC headphones which are probably like 95% as good as these headphones in terms of both ANC as well as sound quality (after fiddling with equalizer) under $100 which is way more value for money.","Probably my only complaint with the SoundCore headphones is the mic quality which causes trouble during calls in noisy environment (which these Sony headphones were the boss at).TLDR: Not worth the price.","Otherwise, go with SoundCore ANC headphones.","Had to switch to this model because XM3 is becoming very hard to findI don't understand the glowing reviewsIt's a step down on the WH-1000XM3 in possibly every way except battery life, which was already long enough to begin withThe padding is much less comfortableBass was apparently balanced and boosted by someone who's deaf to lower frequenciesSize adjustment is needlessly fashionable yet unpracticalMuch more sensible to internal sound from your mouth, or the jack cable touching anythingThe right earphone touchpad sensitivity is ridiculously high, to the point it activates on its own at randomBut worse than all this, while my XM3 models died from the right earphone basically frying out in noise cancelling mode, and what do you know, the XM5 already has right earphone issues barely 1 week after purchase, as opposed to 2 yearsRandom crackling, \"underwater\" audio, issues which can only be fixed by... slapping the earphoneNeedless to say it's not going to last long at this rateAt that price mark this is practically a bad joke and a scam","Great noise cancellation and great sound.","Amazing sound quality.","Casual listening…jazz, classical, rock…The best quality sound with noise cancelling.","For me the standout feature is it's battery life, It's been a week now and battery is still at 16 % without single charge, overall I guess it last between 23-26 hours with ANC.Sound quality is good when you use custom equalizer setting but It's not outstanding, may be I was expecting magic out of it.","The headphones sounds good, but they are uncomfortable to wear for long hours.","The sound quality of XM5 is amazing, it’s bass heavy.","It is my First Headphones from Sony.I bet you will never regret buying this.The crisp and clear sound with theatre like bass.It enhanced my experience of enjoying multimedia.","The latest firmware update fixes this — and makes this issue less frequent (almost nonexistent).I have always enjoyed the sound quality on SONY, but with XM5, you can definitely notice a change (if you're used to XM3, and XM4 sound signatures).","If you can easily to hear all noises near around then what does it mean.Second Comfortability,  Your head will start paining after 30 min from the top side.Last Sound Quality: This headphone not for music listers.Poor Application, Pricing is bit high and worthless.","Yes, it seems that at least Sony understands how to handle clamp pressure appropriately on that end.Here's where the problem lies - THE SOUND QUALITY!","I've seen a number of reviews that mention that these cans have great sound quality.","I've got a piece of advice for you - either go back in time and get the original MDR-1000X headphones or simply go with the XM4 cans (that pretty much sound exactly the same as the MDR-1000x but I digress).","The sound quality of those cans are leagues above the XM5.","I did a compare and contrast with the sound quality.","The 1000x & XM4's are far punchier and clearer sounding than the XM5's.I've seen some people mentioning that the bass is just right with the XM5's.","Here's the problem though - the XM5's sound very...fizzled out?","There's no punch to the sound, and the worst part is that even listening to people talk on YouTube videos or watching videos, and you'll begin to realize how bad the XM5's are in terms of sound.","People's voices just don't sound right.","You'll even hear sound effects don't even sound as pronounced as you'd hear them in any pair of other headphones or even through tv speakers.","Any music you listen to also sounds very flat and muddy.I really wanted to like the XM5's, truly I did.","They are comfy headphones in terms of clamp pressure after all, but considering the very disappointing sound quality combined with extremely cheap build quality, the XM5's have to be returned.Sony, if you're reading this, please take note!","We don't care about excuses anymore, please go back to the trademark sound of older models at the very least if you can't do anything about build quality.","The sound quality is also excellent.","Each time I have to go through a connection process usually several times - usually involving removing the headphones from the sound output device and starting to connect them again from scratch - before the headphones will connect again.","Great noise cancellation and sound(once you use the equalizer).","They are incredibly comfortable, have crystal clear sound, and solid battery life.","The sound quality is great - not only does the sound cancelling work incredibly well, but the audio quality is clear and bright.","Using the app was pretty easy and user-friendly for setting up 360 sound as well as for accessing the mixer.","The XM5 literally sound like those Panasonic earbuds you get at the 99 cent store.","There is zero instrument separation, it all sounds like a bunch of noise crammed together.","Even the XB900n sound better.","No matter how you go into Sound Settings or Devices you CANNOT “connect” to the paired Sony wh1000xm5 selecting the “handsfree” one which activates the mics.","Incredible sound quality across the entire spectrum of sound.","Had these about a week and in my opinion these sound better than my Airpods Max.","The sound quality is excellent with a good balance of low, mid, and high frequencies.","As long as all devices are signed into the same iCloud acct you can move the headphones from device to device with no effort.These Sony headphones are cheaper, sound better, and are lighter and more comfortable to wear than Airpods Max.Highly recommended.","It has amazing sound quality, I don't know how to describe but this is the best headset available in the market right now.","This si my opinion after one month of use and i am very disappointed.Pro - Good Noice Cancelling- charing battery fastCon - Head band very, very unconfortable after 1h of use- No folding, the new case is much bigger.l- No NFC for connecting with phone- Sound not a big difference from XM2- designSomehow i like the new XM5 but is not better than the XM2 which is much older.First of all the confort, is terrible, the head band is very narrow and and not so soft like the XM2 and i believe XM3 and XM4 are the same.In matter of sound quality you have to listen very carefull to notice a difference, if you think are 3 generation apart you expect something better.You can't fold them, the new case take so much space.On the XM2 i had NFC and i just touched the phone to the headphones and the connection was super fast, super effective.Not anymore with XM5.My personal opinion if you have Sony XM4 or below the XM5 is just a waste of money.","It's not the most natural-sounding, but it does the job.And everything else feels like the regular incremental upgrades you get between generations.","Again, sound and ANC seem superior to the XM4 to my ears.","If I had to pick between the two at their price points, I'd go with the XM5 strictly off the new design, but if it's sound-based, they're admittedly not too far off each other.","It also has a long range.5) Long battery life and charges fast.6) App features/options - Several options for customizing EQ settings, noise cancellation, transparency, and so on.7) Multiple device connectivity8) I adore the color Sand (white).9) Sound Quality.","To make it sound even better.10)Much Better Microphone than the previous generation of the XM411)Touch controls shifts seamlessly between swipes and taps.12)Hard Case & Wire – The case is of good quality, the headphones fit perfectly, and there is a slot for a USB C charging cable as well as an audio aux cable.13) The Sony app is packed with features.","It's high quality, with amazing sound quality, is easy to use, is customizable, has many features, and a long battery life.","I slip these on and all I hear is my music or TV :) Which is exactly why I upgraded after only 14 months.Sound quality is great.","I had to use the equalizer from the getgo on the X4s, but I love the sound profile of the X5 \"out of the box.\"","Sony WH-1000XM5 Wireless Industry Leading Noise Canceling Headphones with Auto Noise Canceling Optimizer, Crystal Clear Hands-FrSound wise this is just as good as the previous model.","I for once can't tell the difference between the models, they both sounds great to me.Noice cancellation is real good.","It kept falling when I walk around with it.The sound is not loud enough for my bass taste.I’m returning this.","Best sounding headphones I have ever bought and the noise cancelling is really nice!","More comfortable, better isolation, cancellation, much better sound quality and better build, superior design.","The MX5 sounds good and the ANC was effective, but created a sense of pressure I didn't like.","The noise canceling is absolutely unreal, the sound quality is top tier!","And their voice sounds far more natural through my Bose.All around just really really disappointing, and I'm shocked these get Such great reviews.","It just wasn't my kinda of sound.","Was hoping Sony would improve on the sound front, and it is marginally better than its predecessor, but still not there imho.","And the sound is fairly decent.","In top of all the good stuff, i am totally in love with the option of connecting 2 devices at the same time.Watching TV not worried at missing phone calls, and when I answer the sound is so clear and other side can hear me so clear","Bottom line; they are not even close to the sound quality I was expected.","The best way I can describe the sound is flat and unimpressive.","Now this is how audio is supposed to sound!","The M5s make the AirPods sound like a basic pair of mid-level headphones.","The sound quality is extraordinary.","The sound quality is good and noise cancellation is excellent .","To get sound back you have to turn the headphones all the way off by holding down the power button, then back on by holding down the power button again.","Excellent sound and ANC.","Pros:Great noise cancellation.Great microphone quality.Cons:The sound signature tries to be a jack of all trades but master of none.","When making calls my own voice sounds muffled and it amplifies the background AC fan to sound more like a hairdryer.It gets noticably warm but not too hot.","I can't speak to the noise cancelling or the sound because the discomfort of these headphones overshadows all of that.","I was excited to get these and update my sony 1000xm2 which I've had for 5 years and are still working pretty well.The headphones are comfortable and the sound quality is good, however I'm dissapointed that the noise canceling isn't as strong as the sony 1000xm2.","After month or so of use.Pros:- Very good ANC and sound quality compared to Bose.- Best user experience.","If you want something LOUD, with a BOOMING bass, and crisp sound quality I recommend you get yourself a SkullCandy Crusher Evo headset.","This product eliminates almost 95% of that sound, where it makes it bearable to be in the office.","The quality of the sound is great, much better than anticipated with deep lows and good mid to high range.","Just like the sound of silence.","The noise cancellation works extremely well and the sound quality is incredible.","The sound is amazing and the noise cancelling is better than the QC35s.","Being able to activate ambient sound for the announcements will be awesome.","The ANC is very good, but still a bit of faint ambient sound.","I’ve had them not even 20 minutes and the sound quality/noise cancellation has improved drastically.","These headphones are great, aside from two big problems that could be fixed with a software update:  1) Sony needs reduce the Bass Boost low-pass filter internal setting down to 80Hz or let us adjust it manually as it’s current hardcoded setting is so high that it really trashes the sound quality of the music.","Awesome sound quality and noise cancelation.Well worth the price.","Music rocks, clear, good base great sound stage.","My voice sounds great over phone xalls.","But if hot out can make ears sweet, cups have no ventilation but that results in great sound and noise cancelation.","The sound and microphone quality are great as you would expect.","Sound quality is also phenomenal, very happy there.I live right by a road with a lot of traffic, and I like to sit out back.","I've started using noice cancelling headphones to block out the sound of traffic.","Your experience is much more likely to mirror those than the negative reviews.Amazing noise cancellation, great sound quality, and comfortable enough to wear for hours at a time.","Quite an upgrade from the xm4sBetter sound and noise cancelling but the new case sucks.","Very comfortable and great sound quality.","Okay, the good, the sound quality is decent.","Great sound and noise canceling.","Noise cancellation and sound quality and EP as advertised!","The sound quality on these is really good, but not exactly up to par with some other comparably priced headphones.","I have the Sony XM5 and the Bose QC45.XM5 definitely have better sound quality (the sound is more exciting, bass is amazing).BUT, and this is a big BUT, these are super uncomfortable.The earcups are super shallow, your ears will be touching the inside fabric and your ears start getting hot (really hot) even while sitting.I can’t imagine what will happen if i use them during exercising.The sound quality is not so much better than Bose QC45 that i will tolerate this discomfort.Bose QC45 sound might feel a bit dull compared to the XM5 sound, but the comfort is unmatched.Will be keeping my Bose QC45 and returning these.Really wanted to like these, and they do sound amazing, but the discomfort is a deal breaker.","I've previously owned all generations of Sony's flagship WH-1000 headphones and have always been impressed with the sound and the noise canceling feature which is primarily what they are renowned for.","Sony's flagship headphones have certainly continued to evolve and these are a really amazing evolution.The sound of these headphones is really amazing.","The sound is amazing and if it weren't for the two issues above it would easily be a 5-star product.","The sound is OK but my old Bose were, I think, better.I have a big head (not in the ego sense) and these fit comfortably.","I liked the way sound quality is improved.","TL;DR: *ALMOST* plug and play, noise cancelling second to none, amazing sound quality.These are the first expensive headphones I have ever purchased, and I must say, never have I experienced music like this before.","All in all, if you're looking for some quality headphone that will get you through that midnight flight, look no further.The only negative note that I could find is that initial setup may be a little bit tedious to get it just the way you want it (Account, Assitant, Noise Cancelling, Ambient Sound, linking music provider, Adaptive  control?, and a bunch of other stuff).I know there are audiophiles out there who will tell you to get \"X\" brand because they're so much better or so much cheaper.","Making them tighter, though, only exacerbated the pain on the top of the head.AUDIO QUALITY - The drivers have been reduced to 3 cm, and this is noticeable both in reduced maximum sound pressure level, but also much reduced impact.","However, overall, the headphones sound quite sedate, lack incisiveness, and generally lack the excitement of the prior XM series.ANC - The ANC quality is much reduced compared with the prior models in the XM series.","This is not user error where I have the ambient sound let through.","Overall the noise Canceling is wonderful and definitely won't disappoint.Sound Quality:I am by no means a professional when it comes to audio.","In my own experience I find that these headphones have great sound quality.","Overall it's great sound and definitely an improvement from the XM3.","Sound quality, noise Canceling capability, and comfort of the XM5s is just fantastic and its really a premium experience.","The sound quality and noise cancelling are very good and, if you don't have big ears, they're very comfortable.","I own WH-1000x M3, M4 and M5 (as well as several other headphones).I have to say that this headphones are very good, but they are less confortable than M3 and M4, even when the cup material is softer.Sounds is very good, and noice canceling is great.Not being able to fold them is a downgrade for those using them for travel.","When used with LDAC set at 990k and the Sony EQ app, the sound quality is quite impressive for Bluetooth.","I have tried turning off adaptive sound control, but it doesn't make a difference.","I decided to splurge on these but ultimately decided that they had some flaws that I was not OK with and returned them.Pros-I am not an audiophile, but the sound seems excellent-The Sony app allows you to switch between devices and even allow one device to be uninterrupted-The headphones seem well-built and feel sturdyCons-It took a while for the headphones to connect to any device once turned on and for whatever reason, they allows preferred my PC to my phone.","When I first got these I looooved them, sound quality is amazing on these and I love the touch controls as well as the noise cancellation.","The reason I’m giving this product 3 stars is because every time I went to switch a device the headphones would make this super super loud buzzing sound and they would do this for about 10 seconds and then just shut off.","Great sound quality for being Bluetooth.","So often when I try to swipe up to turn up the sound I instead input the command to skip the song forward or backward.","THE PROBLEM: I do not know if I have a faulty pair but in the past week of me having them (purchased 24 days ago) I have noticed twice now that I will be listening to music then suddenly I will be met with a jarring sound (nearly a screech) for around 4-6 seconds before my headphones suddenly stop my music and disconnect from my phone.","The sound is really good especially.","The sound quality is good.","They are great at canceling background noise, and sound really good.","New XM5 compared to XM4+Noise Cancellation+Call Quality+Battery Life+Charging Speed+Ambient Sound (Close to real sound)+Slightly More Comfortable+Many more minor improvements in hardware and softwareYou can reach me at my Insta for any information- imtiyaz.azhar","The headphones sound muffled and flat when using the wired connection.","However, Apple has led the way in disposable headphones...and other manufactures follow.The app equalizer is very good and a must to optimize the sound.ANC is very good.Connecting is an exercise in frustration.","Nice product and great sound quality.","Sound quality is bit dim but can be adjusted via sony app.","Comfortable with great sound quality.","Balanced sound output.3.","Everything is perfect, ANC, sound quality and app control.","The anc is not that great , you can still hear automobiles and children shouting in distance and any new sound that gets made immediately.","Also the dual connection of bluetooth is not good as it does get connected to two devices simultaneously but still the sound only gets played from the last device connected but it shows that its connected to both the devices.","Great sound quality and superb noise cancelling.If I have to pick a downside: the p2 cable port doesn't carry microphone audio :(This is the best phone you can by as for Feb, 2023.","It feels a bit over priced but the sound quality and the built is better than its competition such as Bose.","Noise cancellation, sound quality are all good, what you'd expect from this series and at this price.","It’s great but if you have an iPhone like me it’s a bit difficult to get used to it.Light weight and very comfy sound quality is great once you customize it.I can wear these all day!","It honestly took me a little bit to appreciate the audio quality difference between these headphones and my AirPods, cause they both sound great, but after a week or so the difference is night and day, they sound amazing!","They are soft and comfortable, great sound quality, and the noise cancellation is unmatched.","Sound quality is great.","I bought these for a trip to Japan and I must say the noise cancellation and sound quality are excellent.","No clue what causes this...but I don't think I can recommend these headphones anymore.ORIGINAL REVIEW (**** out of *****):I recently upgraded from the xm4 to the xm5.I had several issues with the previous version (main one being their flawed, slow multipoint BT connection which caused more frustration than the headphones were worth) but some things they implemented on these xm5s are a bit of a head scratcher.PROS:Great sound qualityGreat noise cancellingGreat fit/comfortLong battery lifeSlimmer and less bulky than xm4Better, but not great, multipoint Bluetooth connectionDouble click for spotify is awesomeCONS:Multipoint - still has issues and I have to restart either the headphones or the device it's connected toNot compact/No longer collapsable like xm4 - bummer for travelingHeadphone case is ok but much prefer the xm4 caseThe multipoint was so awful on the xm4 I gave up on them out of sheer frustration.","I've actual gone without them due to the size of this thing which is a bummer since the sound quality is fantastic.","Learns your environment of background sounds.","Outdoors in Wendy traffic general sounds completely blocked.","The app wants to charge you to get a better sound but really didn’t find much difference.","The app doesn’t give you any options to adjust for better sound.","My only real complaint aside from sound options is that they fit horribly.","I thought I'll try them out and if they don't sound great, I'll send them back.","Both the noise cancellation and sound are amazing.","Noise cancelling is still very annoying, I'll hear all the sound around me till it decides to kick in and block some of it.","**So this review is coming from someone who's worn the M3 Headset for over 4 years and I have to say, it's awful.I live in a place where there's sound in every direction.","Dogs barking, kids screaming, everything you can think of, and ANC is a requirement for getting any work done.So the good:- Ear cups are comfortable, doesn't crush your head after long periods of time.- Sound is good, not absolutely amazing, but good.","You need to download the Sony app to alter the sound to allow any bass to work, otherwise it'll sound static-y.- ANC is awesome but it's adaptive, which I don't like, but can be a plus for some.","When it worked it blocked out almost every single sound.- The case design is cool, it has a little compartment inside that holds the charger cable and headphone jack.The bad:- I'm used to my M3's cancelling noise constantly, this device would adapt to the sound around you, letting sound bleed through before blocking it out after.","Example: I was listening to a song at moderate volume, I could make any sound I want and I couldn't hear it.","Sound is superb, acoustically nuanced with great sound separation, spaciousness, and tight response.","You may want to adjust the EQ to your specific preferences, though it is balanced and brighter than the XM3 enough that is makes the former headset sound muddy after listening to the XM5 headset.","Coming from the WH-1000XM3s I was expecting these to be a great upgrade in terms of comfort, sound quality, and ESPECIALLY noise canceling but unfortunately that's not the case.","It drowns out small annoyances like buzzes and hums from electronics but its effect on voices and sounds around the same decibel level as a casual conversation and above seems to be around 50% effective.","I can still hear the typing of my keyboard, loud sounds outside, the TV show someone's watching down the hall, people talking around me, almost everything!","The sound is beautiful - clear, open, yet warm at the same time.","I've had the WH-1000XM3 headphones for a few years, and they're great - but comparing them to the XM5 now they sound muffled and closed-in!A massive difference is with the quality of the voice pickup, for calls and videos.","The sound is fantastic and the mic is perfect for calls and video.","Sound is absolutely amazing especially with the EQ.","Great sound quality, solid materials, great connectivity and range, but I have to return them.","The sound quality might be slightly better on the XM5s, a little wider sound stage maybe.","If I had my eyes closed and someone randomly put the XM4 or XM5 on my head, I would not be able to reliably determine which ones they were.That said... the sound quality is really good.","I'm not audiophile, but of the sub $500 headphone category, to me these are the best sounding headphones available.Noise canceling is amazing.","Otherwise, both have good noise reduction, good sound and similar adjustments once you do a download from each mfgr.","The noise canceling is great and the sound quality is clean.","The sound quality on them is very good for bluetooth noise cancelling headphones and the Sony app offers a good amount of customization of the learning experience.","Further their integration with Microsoft Teams on Macbook was completely unpredictable (sometimes the sound was fine, sometimes I'd have sound with no mic, sometimes nothing at all, and sometimes nothing for the first 10 seconds of a meeting then they'd suddenly start working).","Sound quality it good, however the headband hurts my head after long use.","The sound suppression is about 3/5 with loud ongoing noise the x3 model was better for that.","In re to WM1000XM5First of all I will start out saying these are very comfortable, and the sound quality is excellent with Bluetooth when functioning.Battery life is satisfactory the first month of use, although I hear the battery is not replaceable.Noise reduction - works very well.","1) Random turn off (not power or user interaction related, and not related to \"keep on while wearing\" setting, _OR_ (2) no sound is output for headphones even though PC shows connected, the player is playing.","Occasionally the sound will stop working here, and tapping the right ear piece in the game will start the YouTube player, but not connect you to the game sound, and sometimes the game sound starts working, and other times you get a mix of both.- Sound delay from sound being played on PC to the time it's actually heard on the headphones is quite noticeable at times and not a fixed but slowly varying quantity.","The noise cancellation is top tier and the sound quality is amazing but there are some really terrible flaws.","I bought these with high expectations and did love the sound, but the headband did give me a bit of a headache so ended up returning","Amazing sound quality.","Unbelievable sound and quality .","Can cancel the sound a bit more but I feel like I am in a surround sound system .Def recommend- I know it’s pricey but worth itOnly question is why would Sony make such a short charging cable!?","I don't consider myself an audiophile but enjoy good sound and have amassed a small collection of headphones anywhere from $50 Vankyo and Monster IEMs all the way to $700 B&O pair, along with Sennheiser, Bose, Shure, VModa, Sony, Jaybirds and others between those two extremes.If you'd rather not read a long review, let me quickly sum things up: these are by far the best all-around headphones I've ever tried.","Sound, noise cancellation, ergonomics, touch interface (on the headphones), Android app, carrying case are each great on their own.","Without this, sound quality will be significantly worse.","The former has excellent noise cancellation and the latter is the all-round pair with my favourite sound without noise cancellation.Noise cancellation seems on par or slightly better than Bose QC35, which is saying a LOT.","Sitting over wing, jet engine noise sounds more like a floor fan.","I find it really helps me keep normal listening volume and noticeably reduce fatigue on 3+ hour flights.Now onto the sound...","I personally have a slight preference for soundstage and overall sound profile from my VModa Crossfade 2's but this is very minor and very subjective.","At 330Kbps, these sound no better than Bose QC35 (which cost way less) and there's no comparison with VModa's that support Qualcomm aptX codec.","You can definitely save some money if you're willing to compromise in the area of noise cancellation or sound but I also think it's pretty easy to justify these Sony's if you have long commutes on public transit and especially if you have long flights.","In terms of its underlying hardware and spec, it's a major upgrade (from Sony's perspective I guess) but the real resulting outcomes are, well, far less substantial than it proclaims to be, at least for me.The overall sound quality for me is quite similar as XM4 is and that's a good sign; however, it does have a narrower or tighter bass for me and in general the sound seems slightly more refined with perhaps a bit more clarity in comparison to XM4.","The specific sound profile(s) that XM5 delivers certainly isn't necessarily suitable for all types of music and depending upon your preferred genre; you may or may not find XM5 appealing or even worthy of an upgrade (comparing to XM4).≡ SpecsWith respect to its specs, it's got BT 5.2 and dual QN1and V1 processors with a total of 8 mics with 4 beam-forming mics.","and balanced sound profiles.","It supports SBC/AAC/LDAC audio codecs.≡ Noise cancellationNoise cancellation works fairly well for the most part and it ain't noticeably better than XM4 for me personally and it heavily depends on the source of the ambient sounds, particularly the frequencies and I feel that its adaptive/auto noise cancellation does NOT work as well as I want it to be in a particularly chatty environment.","Of course, you can manually switch between ANC and transparency (allow ambient sounds in) mode via the button on the left ear cup.","Unfortunately, there are no ANC levels to choose from although the amount of ambient sound to let it can be configured.Strictly speaking though, there isn't any real [significant] difference with respect to ANC in comparison to XM4; they both work more or less equally well in most cases, particularly for higher (relative higher frequencies, not absolutely ones) frequency ranges.","In any event, its noise cancellation capability is amongst one of the best but it's unlikely to work in at all times for everyone (or even most people) because sound perception is highly personal.≡ FeaturesFeature-wise, it's got a similar set of features as XM4 but with minor improvements.","Likewise, it will automatically enable transparency mode to let the sounds in while pausing the music being played if you hold/cover your hand over the right ear cup in order to have a conversation.The 'speak-to-chat' feature (disabled by default as in XM4, press against the touch control with 2 fingers to activate it) is a step up from the 'quick attention' feature that automatically detects if someone is talking to you and would again enable transparency mode and pause the music in order for you to have a quick conversation.","I know the price is high but the sound quality is amazing!","I wasn't extremely excited about the performance at the beginning, but after I took some time to adjust the settings, I am blown away by its outstanding sound clarity, noise cancellation, and smart functionality, so be sure to play around with the settings to find what suits you the best.","When listening to music with the 360 audio, I've heard sounds form songs that I never knew existed or were meant to be heard in those songs before.","These headphones add a whole dimension to music and what you watch or listen to with these.Pros:- Incredible sound, noise cancelation, and sound isolation.- Incredible battery life which auto stop charging when the battery is fully charged.- Included aux cable to allow for instant sound transfer (great for first person shooters to hear footsteps and shots in the distance)- Sound quality is great and even the pass-through sound makes everything around you as if you weren't wearing anything over your ears.- Extremely soft and comfortable to wear.Cons:- They are very pricey, being $100 more than the precious model.- Since it uses AI to automatically change the sensitivity of the noise isolation, sometimes it let's too much sound through.- The speak to chat is kinda annoying because I've accidentally inabled it a few times and then you can't disable it without going on the app.","When it's inabled the moment you speak you can't hear any sounds from whatever you were playing through the headphones, you can only hear what's around you.All in all, if you can afford these headphones and can get used to the auto adaptation of the AI then these are definitely the best wireless headphones you can buy!","The app has multiple features and options to customize and change the EQ settings, the noise cancellation/ambient noise and a feature that I find really interesting: adaptive sound control, which automatically changes between noise cancelling and ambient noise setting depending on where you are/what are you doing.","Although the case is obviously bigger than my Airpod case, the sound quality upgrade and ANC completely makes up for it.","The ambient noise is very good but doesn't sound 100% natural during conversation with others.","The noise cancelling however is top tier and completely nullifies most noise which is amazing when doing work.In conclusion, these headphones were a league above earbuds in terms of sound quality, comfortability, ANC and NC.","- The XM5 is one of the lightest headphones, so it should be great for long flights.Sound: - The XM5 sounds excellent.","I am okay with it, but some may hate this.Ambient: - The app offers several options for ambient sound with 20 levels you can choose from.","Do note that the higher levels amplifies the sound a lot and add a noticable hiss.","The sound is beautiful.","The sound of it on and off as well as the voice that tells you your battery life and stuff is nice to listen too as well.","The only thing is that it gets hot in the summer, but that's with all over the ear headphones.The sound quality is amazing.","I'm really happy with being able to customize my sound using the Sony headphones app on Android.","For the steep price of $500, I definitely want my headphones to tune every other noise out.The sound quality was crystal clear, it made listening to music so pleasant.","I don’t see any difference in the sound quality .","I was amazed at how many different sounds I was able to hear.","Tones, sounds, that were part of the song all along but that I was discovering for the first time with these headphones.","It will stop playing sound from your phone until you restart it.","These headphones had everything I wanted - ANC, two connections at once, great sound, but I couldn't keep them on my head for more than 30 minutes without the headband hurting the top of my head.","Love the simple hand controls on the right ear piece, swipe to change song, volume control, mute sound, etc...  great noise cancellation.","I really love everything on these headphones, great quality great sound and great nois cancelling.","-noise cancellation is wildly good-comfort is incredible with the vegan leather-great sound quality-took a step back from MK4 with no folding design- carrying case, consequently, is bulky and harder to travel with-for $50 less, you're just about as well with purchasing the MK4's but these are great and I would recommend","Sound wise, the Headphones I use at home are Audioquest nighthawk carbon and Sennheiser HD650.","Many players have EQ settings so that’s not a problem if the headphones sound right to begin with.","These sound very good.","I really love the sound quality and noise canceling of this new Sony WH 1000XM5 but I hate the tight fit and pressure on my head that I can't wear it for more than hour.","When comparing to the mx4 the sound is slightly but noticeably better, and same for the noise cancellation.","Sound, noise cancellation, build quality and comfort.","Sound quality is not bad.","It's great but I find the sound isolation a bit lacking, but overall is still a good buy.","I brought the white one originally but it had issue with buzzing sound and static, but there wasn't any issue with the black one.","I kept the bose 700, most comfortable, better sound and anc, best build construction.First impression, the material used felt cheap.","I am petite overall, so if you are a small person, the fit will likely be off.Sound was great, anc was great.","I purchased the Anker q35 at the same time, and felt the sound and anc to be comparable on both which was upsetting considering the price of the Sony.The Sony touch is EXTREMLY glitchy.","It would stop working, and I would have to restart it to get them working.The bose after some eq adjustments sounds better, anc is better, touch settings appear better.","The noise cancelation is adequate, but the ambient sound mode is poor at best.","The audio quality is muddy, if audio is your priority look elsewhere such as Shure.If Shure had better noise cancelling I would much prefer them.I like clear precise audio with a flat response, these have reasonably tight bass, but far from clear.I have tried the soundcore, the bass is wildly uncontrolled, the Sony's are far suppiorior to the soundcore.I use the geadphones in the shop with many loud machines, the noise canlling is adequate.","This has amazing sound and noise cancellation.","Sometimes when I adjust the headphone, sound stops while video is running.","Randomly volume and behavior of sound changes.","I use this for music, gaming, and working from home so I need to wear this for long periods of timeI've been using the Sony WH-1000XM4's since they came and wanted to upgrade to the newer ones.Issues:- The ANC is worse on the XM5 than the XM4, when you tilt your head left and right - sound seeps in.","After prolonged use (~3-4 hours) I get a headache from using it.Pros:- Sound quality is great, as usual.","These headphones are amazing after some adjustments.I find these EQ settings to be the best for neutral sound after spending over 25 hours with them.","I like how they feel, sound and cancel sound well worth it","When i do a bench press or any activity laying down, it keeps falling down but this is so far the best headphone i ever had from the sound quality and the battery life.","I could live with it, but reluctantly.I do like the softer command sounds.","Noise cancellation: +Sound quality: +Volume control: +These headphones are great!","The sound quality is great as well.","These headphones contained a very jumbled sound, muddied really.","The sound IS better on the Bose QC 45s.","Great Noise Cancelling, Good Sounds Quality.","The bass feels slightly off, but these sound better than any other wireless headphones I have tried.","She loves it and says fantastic sound quality and noise cancellation.","The microphone also sounded wobbled, I recorded multiple samples.","The sound is more bassy though, AirPod Max is slightly more comfortable for big ears, otherwise overall Sony is much better than AirPod Max.","The microphone also sounded equally good or equally bad on voice memo on iPhone.Also have tried Bose QC 35 II, QC 700, ANC is not comparable to Sony's, the sound signature is also not comparable, but QCs are much more soft and comfortable for big ears.",".. sound quality i like my air pod pro !!","But if you are in android phone , then you don’t have to worry lot, it sound excellent in android phone and laptops too.","The sound quality isn't bad except when I start using the mic.","looking for some decent sounding headphones.","Boy, am I ever glad that I did!While most of the references were about the WH-1000XM4, this newer model is even better!The Sound (most important to me): I have to admit that I was blown away by the quality of sound from the first testing.","It was such a difference, clearer and more “pure” sounding.","Acoustic, full on band, live recordings all sound fuller and richer (even more so with Sony’s 360 degree sound enhanced music!","A feature I honestly thought I wouldn’t need (I use my headphones mainly while I work from home), adds to the focus on the sound quality and keeps me from being disturbed by outside influences.Battery Life: Varies.","They revert to their stock frequency response profile when used wired, but the sound is much better than Bluetooth, of course.","The product is perfect and awesome.ANC is better then Sony buds.best sound quality.perfect for traveling.","Excellent noise cancelling, sound quality, and battery life.","Great headphones overall they were very light but im my honest opinion I like better the AirPods Max because they sound more loud and the spacial audio and I feel the the max are more crisp in sound than the xm5.","If that sounds annoying, yes, it is.","Both sound similar.","Haven’t tried the sound yet but they feel like butter.","Sound quality is great as well as noice cancelling.","BOSE's QC45 noise cancellation is better than SONY's, I can still hear the noise of children, but I can't hear it at all when I wear BOSE's QC45, but the sound quality of the headphones is very good.I'll keep it because I need a wired headset.","It keeps turning on speak to chat, and even the speak to chat is so f***ing oversensitive that it picks up subway sounds and coughs as me talking.Do yourself a favor and get the XM3 instead.","They sounded fantastic, so I'll give it 2 stars.","*edit: hadn't used em much past initial testing today, MY GOD THESE SOUND SO GOOD IT MAKES YOU WANNA SLAP YO MOMMADoes the very basic stuff headphones are supposed to well which is far too rare these days.Audio quality is amazing for wireless headphones, the mic actually works well so far (only tested for calls).Works perfectly without any tweaking, however I recommend taking some time to familiarize yourself with the Sony Headphones Connect app - it allows some seriously useful customization/optimization features, most of which are just checking a box and Sont does the rest.","My fiancée bought a pair of $60 headphones that have better noise cancellation than these WH-1000XM5 headphones that claim to be state-of-the-art, however, the sound quality of these headphones is unmatched.","I have listened to many different headphones and these headphones are the best on the market at the time of writing this review.They’re also lightweight and easy to carry for travel since they come with a case; the user just has to turn the ear muffs and reduce the band length to fit the headphones in the case.Just because these headphones have great sound and are perfect for travel doesn’t excuse the terrible noise cancellation.","These headphones have always sounded great but this takes things to a whole new level","To the core now, the sound is excellent as always with Sony headphones.","Meanwhile, be cautious when you cross the street with these on although I was able to hear some car sounds from larger cars.","The ambient sound was pretty similar to the previous(meaning it's good) but I'd say it's not as natural as the Airpods series(Airpods Pro I'm comparing to here since I'm too poor for Pro Max :).Up until this point, it probably seems like a 5 star review but the following would be my complaints.","++PROS+++ Paired easily to both my phone and PC (individually)+ Using Tidal as a music service to get high quality audio - sounds awesome+ The fit is comfortable, even for long listening sessions+ Good battery life--CONS--- The noise cancellation is good, but could be better- Setting up the multipoint connection (PC/phone simultaneously) was not as intuitive","Why with that smell I love the sound but the strong smell is disturbing.","I can say he is particular about sound and comfort of headphones.","He already has apple pro buds and Sennheiser, but didn’t have noise canceling over the ear phones.After using them for a week he called me to tell how amazing the sound was, he listens to live shows exclusively and like his music at volume 11.","I have had no issue of any drop at all.5) Battery/Charging - Long enough and charges quickly6) App features/Options - Multiple options to customize EQ setting, noise cancellation, transparency etc.7) Multiple device connectivity8) Love the Sand (white) color9) Sound Quality - Last but not the least sound quality is amazing.","But if you customize the EQ and bump little bit the Clear bass and treble it just sounds amazing.It's been 6 hours non-stop listening for me, I have played all kind of genre and they all sound great.XM5-Not so good1) Carrying Case - Case is little big, flatter.","With zoom it’s even more weird but I think that’s more to do with zooms interface than these headphones so I’m not faulting them here.Otherwise the sound quality is nice AF!","These headphones are only slightly more comfortable than the XM4, however they tend to let sound in and come off my ears when I moved my head around.","This may be fixed further down the road with a software update.I will say the sound is cleaner than the XM4 and sounds a bit more natural and well rounded somehow.","I am not an expert on audio but it definitely sounds a tad bit cleaner.","I had to get used to the XM4s sound profile again when I ended up returning these but they are still a great headset.","I think these could be 5 star with some better earpads and some software updates, especially if you dig the cleaner less bassy sound profile.","The XM4s still sound pretty good, and I would not recommend upgrading to these right now at this price point.","They are the most comfortable headphones I’ve had and the sound quality is top notch.","This also helps make the headphones much more durable overall.In terms of the previous generation model, put quite simply, sound quality is more in line with a neutral profile sounding acoustically tuned pair of reference headphones.","Also the sound profile of the previous generation WH-1000XM4s can be easily restored by using the \"excited\" EQ setting in the companion app settings.Those carbon fiber dual drivers, 8 noise canceling mics and custom audio co-processor Sony keeps referring to in the marketing materials, are genuinely significant.","I don’t notice any exceptional sound quality with these headphones (to my disappointment).","big issue in call.-Sound notification (on, off, pairing, connected), are so random, you don't know what's happening, and what's the status.","Still sound quality is great","But the best part about these is the sound quality.","Incredible 360 sound, excellent base, superb sound quality and amazing battery life.","It makes this somewhat scratchy sound when you move your head, which means the headband fit isn't made for users with eyeglasses.","Am not blown away by the sound quality but after tuning the equaliser settings, I am happy with it.ANC is top notch, it’s definitely best in that category, maybe beating even AirPods Max.Quality of materials used is right for its price, can’t expect more but the cushioning is just great!","Very satisfied and the sound quality is great as well.","The sound cancelling in these are amazing, as is the sound.","The sound is simply great.","They sound slightly better too, their design is amazing which helps in a better noise canceling experience and they have different system sound for turning on/off etc.","Good quality sound, ease of use and comfortable to wear for long periods.","Sound great, just not liking the automatic noise cancelling feature switching itself at random","Pros1) ANC (but not mind-blowing)2) Bluetooth Connectivity3) Touch Control4) Mobile Application with loaded featuresCons1) Sound Quality isn't that great for this price range2) Bass is minimal","I love everything about these headphones -- noise cancellation, touch controls, transparency mode and sound quality.","I've had these for about 2 months, with heavy use.They have have excellent sound quality, battery life, and build quality, but basically everything else about them is crap.","Most automatic/convenience features are nearly unusable.The noise cancelling works well for low pitched sounds, but does virtually nothing for higher pitched sounds, and cannot be adjusted.","Fortunately the passive sound insulation is pretty decent.The software interface is pitiful.","They say the new carbon-fiber material and tinkering with the tuning makes it sound better.","Perhaps, but why didn't they just use the new material AND keep the 40mm drivers, as a larger driver will normally yield stronger sound, though some may say it's not necessary.","While the sound and NC are still excellent, the \"oomph\" or power of the 40mm drivers they used in previous models is not there.","Finally, the Ambient Sound issue people are mentioning is a problem, as it keeps adjusting on and off and cannot be controlled.","First a knocking sound started in the right ear when shaking, or driving in a car over pot holes and the headphones no longer sat tightly against my ears.","Then they twisted until the wires connecting the headphones completely sheared off, that that point it didnt charge, turn on and although sound came from the left ear with aux it obviously could not work in the right ear.","Things that have not worked so far include putting the headphones on a heating pad set to about 110°F overnight, wrapping them in said heating pad overnight, using a blow-dryer for 30 minutes (all I could stand w/o noise cancelling).My environment is not hot or particularly humid, I mostly am at 68 to 72° and 40 to 60%RH.I would give 4 stars for sound if not for this issue.They sound ok, but not as good as my big cans or my KZ ZSX & FIIO BTR5.","I did try driving these with the BTR5 and they do get a little louder, but sound essentially the same, the same sound and the same faults with the sound.I do not wear these for exercise or where I know I will sweat, but they should be able to handle whatever normally happens from being put on a human being's head for 16 hours a day.This is just not a problem that a state-of-the-art headphone should be having.","The sound was great noise definition great but I had to return three times due to not charging one time the charging port melted.","They sound amazing but the top of my head is literally sore from wearing them.","Do keep in mind, the sound will not be as good as when it is powered due to the electronics not actively EQ’ing out the deficiencies of the driver.","Moving over to transparency mode and I find that the AirPods Max slightly edges the XM5s in the sense of naturalness to the sound.","It simply sounds more like I don’t have a headphone on my head with the AirPods Max more so than the XM5s which sound a tad bit processed.","I can still however, easily hold conversations on my XM5s transparency mode with my co-workers at work or hear announcements on the train platforms.Call quality between the two is also excellent but the XM5s edge out the AirPods Max in the ability to literally make you sound like you’re in a quiet room despite there being wind or noises in the background.","Great job!Lastly, the sound.","I would describe the default sound of the XM5s as warm.","The XM5s midrange also has more fullness to it which makes the overall sound more in your face and vivid.","The XM5s bass is much, much improved over the XM4 and now sounds very tactile, precise and still full of oomph and power.","The AirPods Max bass is more emphasized in the sub bass, with a flatter and more neutral mid to upper bass response and also has a precise and tactile sounding bass profile.","Soundstage between the two is great but the AirPods Max sounds a bit airier and spacious even after EQ'ing the XM5s.","Details and subtle nuances sound a tad easier to hear on the AirPods Max as a result as well.","The XM5 is still no slouch and music sound very detailed and clear despite the warmer turning which just shows how well controlled the XM5s speaker is in its transient response.","So, while the AirPods Max is the more neutral and slightly clearer sounding option, the XM5s is the more punchy and smooth option.","All in all, I can live with either the AirPods Max or XM5 in terms of sound, but if I had to choose, my preference is the AirPods Max because I tend to prefer a more accurate and spacious sound.","Like stated before, the XM5 can be EQ'd to sound neutral (And it sounds amazing when EQ'd btw) but the soundstage still lacks a tad bit compared to the AirPods Max.","Soundstage can't be EQ'd since it's an inherent part of the physical speaker design.","The XM5 is the more versatile option in terms of sound because of the EQ since you can turn them from bass cannons to flat and sterile very easily through the app.","AirPods Max's available EQ option is simply presets within the Music settings for iOS or a third party app which neither will store the adjusted sound to the headphone's memory like the XM5s.","A quick mention is that I find that the XM4 sounds overly bright and boomy in comparison to the AirPods Max or XM5 even after endless attempts of trying to EQ them using the app.","Sony really improved the quality of sound on the XM5 and they are the best sounding yet in the WH lineup.In conclusion, the AirPods Max and Sony XM5 are at the top.","Not worth the price previous generation sounds better in noise cancellation and volume control.","Bought them for my first ever expensive headphones but honestly paying 400+ for them ain’t worth it, the series before them sound way better and have better volume","The most noticeable is the sound quality.","I have listened to sound through my iPhone, iPad and TV.","Within 5 minutes of pairing, the sound crackles and is horrible.","I did return them an got the bose QC45 which are way more confortable with a compromise to sound.","Sound quality for music and movies3.","Look great sound great, battery, only downside is the price but if this is your budget get them.","Like the features, very good sound quality.","Been really enjoying the headphones: the bluetooth multipoint support is really nice and the build and sound quality is decent.","The sound is good but if the cups were made out of something denser it would noise cancel 10x better.","It gets rid of almost all the background noise including the awful piped-in sound.","The sound quality was SUPERB.","I love the sound quality, it's really easy to set them up and the Sony Headphones app offers great audio customization.","Three days later, can't get sound out of the left ear.","I would be listening to music, and the sound would stop abruptly in the middle of a song or a video.","But there were no in depth instructions on what the different buttons are for.It did, however, push for the 360 sound that you have to pay a subscription for.","Although the sound is better with the 360.","My iPods have better sound without a subscription.As far as noise cancellation, it worked the first time.","Bose have been my go to head phones I actually sent the Bose 700 back because they were lacking in sound.","The Sony xm5 sounds great and are comfortable but the the sensor control on right side only works half the time.","The sound quality was great but the material feels cheap.","Every day, especially during video calls, they stop playing playing sound, or recording sound, or both.","The sound quality and noise cancelling are great, but I just can’t seem to get them loud enough.","Sound quality is the best I’ve ever heard, and with the app you can fully customize sound levels.","The sound quality is pretty good, and noise cancelling is not bad, but Bose 700 does a better job.","battery life is much more without anc … sound quality is amazing … just only 1 drawback that the leather ear pads are too much sweaty .. order a pair of velour earpads with them which would cost around 1500 rupees !","Noise cancellation, sound quality, battery life all get a 5/5, the ability to recharge the battery in minutes and last for hours is a force to be reckoned with.","This also means that if you turn your head too much, gaps appear between your head and the headphone, letting sound leak in.","They have excellent noise cancellation, great sound quality and they are super light.","Sony has downgraded from xm4.The only 2 good things in this headphones are fast charging and sound quality.Don't buy if you are looking for noise cancellation, comfortablity or upgrade from xm4.","sound is amazing whether watching a movie, playing a game, or listening to music.","In terms of sound quality, I am not an audiophile but I feel this is the one area where they are at least equal, everything else is a wash.- Noise Cancelling.","There's even an option on the app to send Sony a picture of your ears to improve sound quality (i guess?)","The sound, mic and ANC when it works are okay but I don't think these are worth all the issues that comes right out the box with the headset.I'm not sure if this headphones have an update that will fix these issues but my experience has been absolutely horrible given I spent so much money on the product.","Noise reduction in the airplane ended up being much more than 95%… you heard that right :) to me it felt like almost complete noise reduction, so much that I could hear my breathing and could lower the overall sound levels to below 50%.","Better than some sound isolation phone booths!Cons: ears can get warm but ok for airplane ride; voice passthrough for phone calls/teams calls is a little weird and takes getting used to; cost","As far as wireless travel headphones go, these are the best I've ever heard.However, I found that something felt 'off' to me in the tuning of the sound profile for these headphones.","Even sitting at my desk I would move around and notice outside sound suddenly leaking in.","The Sony app lets you manually chang between connection quality (basically makes LDAC the same as SBC ) and sound quality.","Optimizing for sound quality, is totally unstable and the sound immediately has pops, stuttering, and other artifacts.","The bass sounds so weird when you turn up the \"clearbass\".","And that was one of the selling points to me from reviews is that people say Sony has warmer bass feel.So, I end up with headphones that are unlistenable at high quality setting, and sound worse than my Bose.I returned them, heartbroken.Since then, I have some new Anker in ear wireless buds with ANC that sound better.","The sound is amazing, noise cancelling spot on, but the product manager blew it on one thing.","they are really heavy, not comfortable at all, The Sony WH-1000XM5, are very comfortable to wear, the battery last a long time, and you can pair them to 2 deceives at the same time which is a really neat feature if you are working in your computer and get a phone call, the sound quality is very impressive, the noise cancellation is good and ambient mode is descent ,  ambient mode is not as good as the airpods max, but considering everything else, I would go with this ones.","The sound blowed out.","Low end sounds fantastic.Mids and highs are completely absent.","It really does sound like a 25$ pair of headphones.The sound is relatively accurate though.","It sounds exactly as if the audio is muffled.","Bought noise cancelling headphones for my CPTSD (I’m sensitive to unpredictable sounds and I needed something to help me get through family gatherings for the holidays.)","The Dolby Atmos surround sound is marvelous.","It sounds like you are not wearing headphones at all.","External sounds on the Sony's are a bit muffled, and listening to your voice is irritating.-- Sound Quality: I found that both headphones have excellent sound quality.","For classical, it sounded flatter and tinnier than Apple's full sound.","For that degree of control, the WH-1000XM5s have a slight advantage in sound quality.-- Summary: The AirPods Max beat Sony's in several categories and remains my favorite headphones.","The better price, sound quality, and storage are likely noticeable enough to many that they would purchase them over the AirPods.","I can't imagine what \"loud\" is on these...- Sound stage is excellent.","I've disabled, but it still makes the touch sound...- Dog barking and people talking still leaks through.","Battery life, sound quality, everything is great!","I use these pretty much everyday, specially for online meetings and watching videos and listening to music on my laptop.➡️ Coming from Bose QC 35 I must say it's a huge improvement sound quality wise and the ANC feature.","While sitting next to my gaming PC with fans on 100%Pass through(7/10) putting your hand over the right ear cup allows for environmental sounds to pass through.","Which is cool but doesn't sound natural.Sound quality (10/10) amazing especially when tweaking the eq a bit.","Sounds are so crispy the bass the vocals everything was amazing.Build and comfort(8/10) not sure if it's our ears but the headphones sit on top of our ears.","Both headphones are not close in price but they do share the same features and are from well regarded brands.ANC- These headphones definitely have really impressive ANC, the sound is not the best but if you absolutely need the best ANC then these will probably be it based on so many online reviews.","Other headphones with ANC will often change the noice reduction as you turn because the mics are picking up new sounds.","Because these have mics everywhere, they are always picking up noice from all directions at once  and canceling it.Calls- The addition of mics also helps cancel more sounds while on a call and the voice detection looks to be doing a really good job at separating your voice for a really good call in a noisy environment.","The pads are most likely made of some type of rubber which still feels pretty comfortable.Sound- I had to update this section because the sound is greatly improved with the EQ, the preset ones are a joke but luckily the EQ is super easy to use.","Not paying attention to this is what gave me an initial bad impression of the sound.","I personally just gave it the popular V tuning and it sounds really good now with nice deep lows and satisfying kicks.One thing that I do have to add about the sound is that these sound horrible when wired, I’m assuming that they really heavily on their DSP for the tuning.","I connected them to my Fiio player which should have more than enough power and they just sound horrible.","So basically they sound good while their on and in Bluetooth but if you run out of battery and use the headphone jack they will sound horrible, luckily they charge super quickly.Comparison- I honestly prefer the 40s a bit more because they offer better sound despite not coming close to the ANC of these, they are not terrible but the ANC on these are next level.","The 40s also sound really good when using the headphone jack.","They sound good but not the best I’ve heard for wireless headphones.","I rated them five stars after noticing the EQ settings and better adjusting the sound to my liking.","As far as sound quality, I would rate the AirPods Max slightly ahead of the XM5, but it depends on what you're listening to.","But you can customize the sound profile on the XM5 quite a bit by using the Sony app.","Excellent headphones with great sound quality and noise cancellation.","Still have not gone through all the features, functions, and app but based just based off the sound alone I am extremely satisfied","Sony WH-1000XM5 is an awesome product in this category with great ANC, sound quality and extreme comfort wearing them.Looks are very premium, even to the touch of materials and cushion.","If you have used a premium TWS from pixel or airpods, it's a step-up even from the great ANC provided on these TWS.Ambient mode (transparent mode) is great at making the voices around sound clearer.","You can also adjust how much ambient noise should be let through (even suppress background noise and allow only voice frequencies through which is very good.Sound quality is really good, but it's very subjective, I guess.","Amazing sound quality, can wear it for long periods of time without strain, and the app has a lot of useful features","Sound quality is great.","Fantabulous sound plus it measures the pressure on your ear as per WHO recommended levels, which is phenomenal.","I love the noise cancellation on these, and the sound is fantastic, or would be.","I purchased the headphones 2 months ago and have been able to use them for maybe 2 weeks total.The noise cancelling is great, bluetooth range is wonderful and the sound quality was originally awesome.","The sound and noise cancellation work great but the design is HORRIBLE compared to the XM4s.You can’t fold them, they smack together when you pick them up like the airpod pros I returned, they adjust with the slightest movement.","Blocks all the sounds from loud cars, loud music (in cars right outside my window), Loud talking and walking neighbors.","They seem to be pretty decent overall - sound is good, noise canx is good.","I liked these headphones a lot, but within the first month of use the right ear started playing little crackly sounds that were louder than the music.","I suppose the sound quality was fine.","First, it should be said the XM4s are superior to the Bose QC-35s in comfort, sound and ANC.","The headband is slightly less comfortable than the XM4.Sound quality is an improvement that was noticeable.","I'll keep them, but the XM4 I personally wouldn't upgrade to the XM5 for the slightly better sound and cancellation.","Sound quality is amazing and the noise cancelling on an airplane is almost unbelievable.","The EAH-A800 are better at noise cancellation & ambient modes  and have great sound reproduction & best of all I can wear them for hours with no discomfort.","Yes Sony does a lot of advertising but the Technics are made by Panasonic and they have a great history in reproducing quality sound.","I can't even hear the noisy (~60dB) fans on my computer with these headphones on.Noise cancellation is improved, but I did find it had some issues with (1) eating (where the jaw bone is moving the ear cups) and (2) moving your head side to side (getting some false noise readings where the surface is sound absorbent, like an airplane seat).","The noise cancellation and sound quality are superior to similar Bose headphones in my opinion.","Functionally, it is on par with the M3 and M4.Sound-wise, it sounds about the same - no complaints.The noise cancellation, however, is not as good as the M3 or M4.","This was very effective and I had no complaints.The M5 seems to dynamically determine environment and cancellation by constantly sampling sounds in the environment.","The sound and noise cancelation is very good.","When I am listening to something on my tablet, if the sound pauses for even a microsecond it always switches over to my TV audio device.","It checked all the boxes in terms of sound quaility, noise cancellation, and volume control, but it would slide off my head from the littlest of movement.","Sony has the lead in that category.Sound was better at default settings than the XM4 but I have several options I prefer such as the Shure Aonic 50 (good out of the box with a class leading EQ) and the AirPods Max (I really like their sound signature but it isn't for everyone).","The EQ in Sony's class leading app improves the sound (for an easy adjustment I recommend \"bright\" then adfjust to taste if needed) but not to the level of the other two options.","To be fair if you like the Sony XM sound you'll like these as it's an improved version of it.This is a good product but it wasn't for me only because I have at least two better options.","They sound great but I think the noise cancellation option is better on the xm4.","When Inwas sitting in a hotel room I suddenly got a weird sound on the right part of my xm5.","Overall regret this purchase relative to bose.Pros:- Look good- Sound quality is OKCons:- Active Noise Cancelling is an absolute joke on these.","I did configure the app, and turned off the adaptive sound control so I ould keep Noise Cancelling always on.","The quality of sound, noise cancelling and Alexa features out performs the rest.","The sound is amazing and noise cancelation is crazy.","Very functional, Good sound, not fantastic but still good.","The Apples worked sounded great in an Apple Genius store full of customers.","Love the sound quality, noise cancellation is comfortable and it doesn’t feel like i’m in a vacuum, battery life is impeccable, mic is great (very good at voice isolation) and honestly they look so cute.","Highly recommend, if you’re really noise picky the app does have its own equalizer and plenty of sound techs have publicized their preferences for these specific headphones!","Seamless connectivity switch between 2 devicesWorth the price tagSound quality-5/5NC-5/5Battery-5/5","Its definitely an upgrade for sure, the anc and sound quality are a tad bit better.","Couldn’t test noise cancelling or sound because they were enormous.","PROS:-highest rated overall headphones for 2022 for comfort, sound quality, mic quality according to some on youtube-comfortable-decent ANC-honestly pretty muddy sound qualityCONS:-no mute function for the microphone-\"customizable buttons\" in the app dont have any actual options for the functions-no fast-charging-really good microphone, stays connected to 2 devices better than bose* returned mine because i need the mute mic function.","The silly \"adaptive\" sound cancellation \"feature\" constantly causes noise cancellation to turn on and off, at roughly 10 second intervals.","Best setting if coming from XM4's is ExcitedThey can be more comfortable and all but NC is way weaker than XM4's in trains and you CAN'T DEACTIVATE the \"Auto NC\".. not on the settings, not Ambient Sound, anywhere... You van set everything to Noise Cancelling but it still changes automatically MESSING UP THE EXPERIENCE.","Excellent build quality.Very good sound.LOUSY NOISE CANCELLATION!I returned them because of that.","Clear rich sound and unbelievable noise canceling","Noise cancellation worksWell; sound quality best in class","They also support LDAC via Bluetooth with ANC  & they sound phenomenal!Now I actually did buy all of these myself, trust me I wish Sony would let me test and/or review these things!","I EQ my headphones, so after that, they both sounded good to me, so not a significant enough difference there.","XM5s we're marginally more comfortable, but not enough to make a difference to me either.The couple things that were much better was it's ability to auto pause when removing the headphones connect to 2 devices at once (XM3 doesn't have that), the ambient sound mode was so much better, and the headphones overall responsiveness to touch/button controls was much faster.As for noise cancelling, I'm convinced that there is variation in noise cancellation strength between each individual pair of WH-1000XM5 headphones.","I've watched videos of sound engineers doing noise-cancelling samples and graphically showing the XM5s beating out other headphones, including the XM3.","Sound is pretty good but these are so light almost plastic feeling.","I like the feel, comfort, and sound coming from the XM5, but bluetooth can be spotty if you have multiple devices paired to this.","Im assuming this would happen to these as well.I’m sure there was a ton of tech that went into them, but at this price point I expected much more in terms of comfort with the ear cups and headband.Sound quality is amazing, but again, comfort shouldn’t be an after thought at this price point.","(headphones to some) While the sound quality is GREAT, Sony falls flat on their face with their current adaptation of what at least some of us require.","I love the touch controls, the NC is great, the sound quality is quite good and the battery lasts for a long time.","In terms of the previous generation model, put quite simply, sound quality is more in line with a neutral profile sounding acoustically tuned pair of reference headphones.","Also the sound profile of the previous generation WH-1000XM4s can be easily restored by using the \"excited\" EQ setting in the companion app settings.","The noise cancellation, sound quality and battery life is amazing!","The sound quality is amazing and the noise cancellation is fantastic.","The price is steep but the performance and sound quality is outstanding.","Ear buds fall out, leak sound and fail to provide adequate noise cancellation.","Comfort, hours of use, excellent sound, touch features, noise cancellation, no external sound leakage, ease of use.... the list goes on...","Charges quickly.Sound - I’m not into headphones and know nothing about sound quality but I like what I hear with these after playing with eq.Operation - speak to chat doesn’t always work but when it does it’s amazing.","It does not block 100% of noise, but it is probably the best I’ve ever tested.Battery life is as expected, but if you like it loud with max noise canceling as well as the DSEE Extreme and Equalizer enabled the battery life definitely takes a hit, but is still good.Sound quality is really good.","Overall, these are first-rate headphones and I would highly recommend them (even over the M’4’s as I like the new design and the sound quality, to my ears at least, is improved over the old model).Update: September 27, 2022.","The sound quality is amazing for my unprofessional ear.","I ordered these and a pair of Oro Sound Tild Pro headset and these outperformed the tild pro which had an actual boom mic and has amazing reviews for noise cancellation in the microphone.","It has an equalizer and allows you to customize the amount of ambient sound that comes through.","As I said I’m not a big audio nerd but the sound quality is the best I’ve experienced in any headphones and I own more than a few pairs.","Any audiophile knows the experience of when you get something that noticeably steps up your sound, you can’t help but go through your whole music collection to re-listen to everything because now its better.","sound I have.","But nothing has made me fall in love at first sound until now.","I am a firm believer there is a true sound at first ear for everyone and this is the one.","As the sound pours through my ears with it soft whispers and vigor bass, I am at awe and excitement at every song, music, and instrumental I have heard before, but now it is uncharted territory for my ear pleasure.","Neither B&W set has a true eq (bass and treble only) but the sound is very good out of the box so I really didn’t mind.","I didn't like the sound quality at all.","Sound is astounding.","The sound quality is better though, but for the price you’d expect the noise cancellation to be better than years old models.","The ANC is unbelievably horrible with these headphones: if you come across sudden loud noises, you'll be met with a huge pressure wave in your ears and often still hear the sound come across loud.","The sound quality, the noise cancellation, the design and quality is just not up to par with the price that’s being asked for.","In terms of audio the sound system is so bright and is lacking some serious base sound which is disappointing to say the very least.","Whenever you adjust the headphones even a bit during a call, they stop working, and the only way to regain sound is to disconnect and reconnect them.","The sound is absolutely amazing!","They also cover your entire ear and the sound quality is simply so good.","The sound quality is nothing exceptional, and for nearly $400, Sony was gracious enough to include a ridiculously short (12\") USB charging cord that won't reach any reasonably close USB port.","The noice cancellation and the sound quality is good.","Ready for the best in class noise cancelling headphones with incredible sound profiles completely customizable?","Clear sound, no distortion whatsoever, signal transmission remains in-tact and stable at any given moment.","Adaptive sound is nice, it auto detects my environment and changes from NC and transparency.","Because I own all the latest NC headphones, I created a comparison below between the 2 best: Sony XM5’ and how they compare with Apple’s Air Pods Max.Sound Quality: Winner TiedI tested the XM5’s using Tidal and Apple Music using both wired and wireless.","I found the music quality on the XM5’s sound better on specific genres such as Jazz, Bossa Nova, Hip-Hop (90’s), Classical Rock, Symphony, and R&B.The APM are ahead when it comes to EDM like House, Drum & Bass, along with Pop and other computerized music.Both headphones are close for most genres, however the biggest difference I noticed between the two was Jazz like genres, with the XM5’s being leagues ahead.This is a tie because it depends on the genre you prefer.Audio Enhancements: Winner Air Pods MaxThe XM5’s offer 360 Audio Reality which is only accessible to less popular streaming music apps like Tidal, while the APM offer Dolby Atmos and Spatial Audio.","The audio library for the sound enhancement is also smaller for Sony with limited selections.Comfort: Winner Sony XM5The XM5 can remain on your head for long periods of time (several hours) without any discomfort given its lightweight feel.","When stationary, they’re fine, but when walking around and tilting your head, they begin to slip off.Features: Winner Sony XM5Sony offers an headphones app accessible from the App Store or Google Play Store which allows you to heavily customize your XM5’s, from building a sound profile, selecting audio pre-sets, adjusting noise cancelling, transparency modes and a great deal more.The APM on the other hand, do not have an app of any kind, besides the ability to select audio pre-sets from the music app you subscribe to.Transparency Mode: Winner Air Pods MaxThe transparency mode on the APM is unlike anything else; I can have full conversations that sound natural.","The XM5’s on the other hand are an upgrade from the XM4’s, but it doesn’t sound as natural as the APM.Microphone: Winner Air Pods MaxThe microphone on the APM is excellent; I’ve hosted hundreds of hours of business meetings and personal phone calls; the microphone is crystal clear and professional.The XM5’s on the other hand is an upgrade from the XM4’s and noticeable a lot better, but the APM are noticeably better.","The Sony’s offer a much better value.Conclusion:There are many factors to take into consideration between both brands, but ultimately, my heart is with the XM5’s because they sound better for the genres I listen to (Jazz) on a daily basis, and it puts me in the musical ‘zone’.","I used to stay near a railway line and the amount of trains going used to make it crazy to work.With these headphones and AnC , it not just cancelled noises for me but even the other person on the call could not hear any background soundAmazing stuff and go for it.","So I will sum my experience about this pair in three major areas Comfort, ANC and Call quality and Sound quality.1.","Sound quality:I have been using expensive earphones for quite a long time I have my audiophile 1more quad drivers, Sennheiser HD 202, Sennheiser Momentum wired earbuds, Oppo enco x and x2's so I believe I now have some understanding about how a good pair should sound, having said that The default Audio quality is decent also it varies which device you are connected, I wud suggest that you should use them with LDAC enabled all the time!!","Its pretty decent nothing mind-blowing but it can be tweaked for amazing soundgazmic experience using app, u can enjoy A.R.","Rehman tracks such as Dil Se and experience a variety of instruments audible suddenly.I woud not compare it with bose, Sennheiser Momentum 4, Airpod max, i believe sound is subjective and everyone has to adjust accordingly and be satisfied with their purchase after they have made an investment and not be disappointed due to subjective opinions other have.Concluding this very long review, these are a value for Money pair of Headphones, I got them at a good discount and hence I went with xm5s rather than xm4s.","I do miss the voice prompts which are in the XM3's but the battery level is still announced when you click the power button.Sound quality is great in both however going back and forth between the 3's and 5's, the difference is quite subtle to me.","A great test album for these for me at least is the Atomic Blonde soundtrack.","When someone opened or balled up a cellophane wrapper I could hear it clearly and I found myself checking to see if I had Ambient Sound on.","Sound seemed about the same although difficult to really  test the sound quality in those environments.I had a shorter 1 hour leg after this which I decided to switch to my new Air Pods Pro2's.","Sound quality a little lower but none the less quite enjoyable and clear.XM5's in general.","Still a phenomenal headset, sound great, cancel noise well enough to satisfy me and fit in my carry-on far better.","If you use spectacles, you won't feel comfortable with these, even if you wear it above your spectacles - you will lose the pure noise cancellation quality as sound enters from the space caused by the spectacles.2.","Overall sound quality fine, but anytime I clear my throat, talk, or for some random reason I am not aware of…the devise pauses my video.","Great quality sound and noise cancelling is top notch.","This means that if there is any change in noise around you whatsoever, these 'noise canceling' headphones will stop noise canceling and just blast your ears with the sounds coming from around you.","My Xm3's had no problem canceling out the noise, but these Xm5's stop canceling noise anytime it picks up any noise coming from me, such as the very, very, quiet sound of me swallowing, sipping water, talking to a mic, and sometimes even breathing.","The sound quality appears to be a downgrade from the Xm3's, but it is difficult to compare them fairly due to how terrible and intermittent the noise canceling on the Xm5's are.","This has happened to me several times while I was on the phone with someone!The sound quality and noise cancellation are amazing.","Sound quality was amazing though.","Granted I know that there are other more expensive than these ones but I am blown away by how dynamic they are and how amazing they sound.","Cons:- I cannot turn off system sounds.","I saved ~$150.- The case is huge.- It does not come with travel, air plane adaptors.- The phones are slow to connect fedora (linux)Pros:- Great sound.","It is not hi res audiophile good, but it is not far off either.- Noise cancelling is greatI have PTSD and random system sounds really hurt me.","I wish I could turn the system sounds off completely.","I can mute out most surrounding noise and the clarity of sound / my voice on video calls is top notch.","I own both the XM3 and XM4 models and I have come to really love both the sound quality and the extra features Sony has packed them.","It keeps track of how much time you listen at various decibel levels so it can tell you if you have been listening too much.Sound quality is of course very good.","I will start with the sound quality and it is magnificent!","It allows you to carry on conversations by pausing the noise cancelling function, the right headphone controls sound lsvel, forward and back, and they are super light.","The sound quality is superb with clean bass, really nice clear mids and good stereo separation during long listening sessions.","I use my headphones constantly so I needed something that would be able to have good audio quality, good call sound, good noise cancelling and somewhat functional.","It’s actually happened multiple times when I’ve been at full volume but the noise coming out of the headphones barely sounds like 3 notches.4.","I was under the impression my calls would sound clearer and sharper (for the other person) and the audio would focus on my voice a lot more than background noise.","9.5/10Sound quality-  10/10ANC-  10/10Ambient mode.","A lot of reviews and videos are already out there on social media for its features, will not comment on those things.•Sound quality out of the box (EQ) isn’t something wow on apple music or spotify premium!","!•The EQ customisation comes to rescue and improves sound staging drastically, m using a Custom EQ which I have attached in my review, it gives better sound staging.","Nobody does headphones sound better than Sony.","Great sound quality and software.. Could be priced better, not value for money product.","The sound quality is among the beat I’ve tried.","I think the sound quality is great for music, as long as you do not touch the equalizer.","If you try to boost the bass or try any of the presets, the sound is just wrong.","The equalizer makes things sound distorted.","Comparing them with these $400 headphones, the Sony headphones are marginally better in sound, not phenomenally, amazingly better, just a slight improvement.The supposedly automated functions are not automatic.","However, my voice sounds very synthesized and unnatural.","The sound cancellation and quality are superb.","They're lightweight, comfortable and I love the material!The sound is great: crisp, smooth and pops!I love the smart features of them pausing and playing depending on whether they're on or off your head.","Beta noise cancelling and sound quality on a pair of headphones I’ve ever owned.","These aren’t as bass heavy and has a more wider soundstage and just sound more balanced.","Wide dynamic sound good separation, great battery life, light and comfortable but I would enjoy deeper pads for my big ears but this would change sound signature, Like the EQ with LDACbut aptX HD sounds really good on Shure 50 when EQ'ed can't compare to planers as planers are more laid back Really enjoy the XM5","My screenshot shows battery life near the end which confirms the 30hr claim and from my experience, the comfort, noise canceling features, and sound all lived up to Sony's claims.Easy buy decision.","Much lighter, better sound quality, all while keeping to a similar control scheme and feel.","From the build quality to the sound these are the best brand that I have ever owned or used.","Awesome noise cancellation, great sound much better than my Bose Quite Comfort","Good sound quality (is meant for other music streaming apps more than Apple Music which I use) and noise cancellation when it works is nice.","Don’t really get the point if this when you can just press a button and either pause the music or switch to ambient sound.","For the price point, I expect the headphones to be damn near perfect, because of my job I have to wear these guys anywhere from 6-15 hours a day so every aspect of a headset is important to me.I am not an audiophile but they sound great to me, rich and stuff.","Great sound, and sound cancelling function, very confortable.","I reluctantly had to get new headphones as I felt my Bose Soundlink II were soon going to die finally (I've had them for many years and love them dearly).","The noise cancelling is great, sound quality is great.","The sound quality is great.","Nice balanced sound, comfortable to wear.","But no problem in sound quality.","The sound quality is comparable with Apple sounds engineered and Sony sounds truer.","Didn’t like the sound.","Best comfort, sound and ANC.","Much more comfortable, 15%ish better sound quality, and the customizable eq via the app is still amazing.","Also, the phones do show fingerprints easily, but wiping keeps them less noticeable.Sound quality is customizable with great eqyalizer embedded in the app.","Like that the sound control is in their app.","I got these for their noise cancelling and ambient sound options.","Poor sound quality and less than premium build quality are surprising coming from Sony but this life.","Couple the right hear with your hand and it temporarily pauses while your hand is there, letting in all ambient sound in.","There is an option that enhances both ambient sound and music at once.","Since I didn't own the last version, I was able to give this headset a fair chance and explore all the new, more advanced features and superior sound it has, and I love it so much!Also, did I mention these headsets can get LOUD?","I bought this product for my brother.Sound quality is excellent","Better sound than the 4 or 3.","Better than the 4's even.The bass is eased up with a more centered sound.","I have no idea what processed pop might sound like on these and don't want to find out.","Loving my worn down old Sony MDR-ZX750BN with a tattered head-band, but with easy controls and great sound.","Yes it has great sound but frequently something would trigger a silence then a sound like \"white noise\", Just saying the fault lays with us and not this new Sony headset.","They cut the interior airplane sound to literally nothing.","The sound quality is great, it is very comfortable to wear, and the noise cancelling feature works very well.","Sadly, one of the hinges broke and I can no longer use them properly, so I when I saw that the XM5s were on sale for 100$ less I instantly jumped on them, figuring they would be an upgrade to the previous generation, the XM4.I was not impressed by the sound, I firmly place them within the same quality class as the previous generation.I read that they improved on noise-cancellation and microphone quality.","Neither are they as portable due to fix sides, but the plastic material feels cheap, and the overall design makes them really difficult to wear when doing anything but sitting still, as they often shift or even fall off entirely, which was not a problem whatsoever with the XM4s!Overall, the sound is still great, but this is not what a \"new\" generation of an electronic device should be.","Top class bass and sound quality, I'm having a lot of fun with LDAC and high-res audio in the apple music.","To keep it short they are Sony headphones - they sound good.","This headphones produce excellent sounds for music lovers and mic is the best of best for everyday phon call , Teams with mobile Bluetooth working fabulous for office calls and ANC is top.","It had a very nice sound, good range of music type handling, wide soundstage, brilliantly executed noise control circuitry, high level of comfort even when listening for hours, marvelously executed connecting app were appreciated by me.","Lots of options to tweak sound, ability to handle phone calls and intelligent user-friendly features (only 2 buttons, customizable functions using the app, highly responsive touch controls, features such as interrupting music when in chat mode or cupping the right headphone to turn off ANC and music to carry out a brief conversation etc were very convenient.It seems well built and with some care should last a decent period.","The 360 Reality is a new feature with fewer sources available but even without it, the soundstage is airy and bright and added novelty to music pieces already listened to for years!","No issues with battery, sound quality, noise cancellation, Microphones all works perfectly.","I can see why this model was consistently near the top, the sound quality, touch controls, comfort, noise cancellation, battery life, are amazing!","Noise cancelling is amazing, sound quality and battery life are amazing too.","The sound quality is good.","Sound quality is fantastic  but my the padding is not thick enough and my ears touch the inside and it gets uncomfortable after a while.Also, the choice of material is questionableas it has a soft plastic covering the cups and within 5 min.","I got my new pair of WH1000XM5 today and I’m absolutely blown away by the sound quality, noise cancelation and comfort that these headphones provide.","These headphones allow me to tune out the noise while also giving incredible sound quality.","I also don’t notice an incredibly large difference between the sound quality in Bluetooth vs wired connection.","The design looks so much better than the previous models.Sound: Trust me when I say this, they sound way better than Sony Xm4’s.","It feels to me that Mark 4’s lost so much of details in the sound quality, when you listen to this.ANC: Noise cancellation has been improved by a lot.They still cannot cancel noise to a 100%, but well, no headphones can do it yet, but it is the best of any headphone out there.","(Airpods max is so close to this), close but not upto this.Transparency/Ambient mode: They sound so much better in this mode than Mark 4’s due to new improved number of mics.","Still cant hear 100% of the outside world (like you still cant hear a song playing in an uber as loud as it sounds without an headphone, but still make out what you’re listening to).","But I can wear these all day and listen to the world outside, it feels like its removing some useless noises of the real world and that sounds good.Cons: They sound a little better in Androids and pc/laptop with LDAC than on any iphone.","But that difference is almost negligible and I still decided to keep them for the iphone because I love the sound.Overall: They’re worth $400, and they’re still cheaper than Airpods max.","They're comfortable on, the call sound is good from both the caller and callee's perspective, and the battery life is impressive, using them for a few calls a day over a week, and I'm still at 60% battery.","Sound quality is good, balanced with decent bass and the equalizer on the app let's you fine tune a bit.Finally, I was shopping for new earphones mainly because I wanted the option to be able to plug them in (travel on a plane), which you cannot do with buds.","They sound really good","I didn’t know music could sound this good until now","So after I have have them for a month now I still can’t seem to get the soft key controls on the side ons the right ear to actually work on the pc I use on a daily basis at work instead I have to open the sound mixer which is a little annoying as everything I use is chrome based applications so it should work and it doesn’t….But I have got to say I can now read lips because the noise cancelation is that good the person sitting next to me has to tap my shoulder to get my

sensation when noise cancelling is on, but it's not intrusive like a lot of other ANC headphones I've tried and effectively disappears when music is playing.","I also assume they use a low density memory foam for cushioning which is great but will eventually need to be replaced or tended to if left compressed or squished for too long.Unique featuresNoise Cancelling is top notch but not much different than their previous lines in my opinion!","It is a standard these days to get noise cancelling and the headphones are great for drowning out noise if need be.","As a pair of noise cancelling headphones, you can expect to hear a positively good detail in music, movies, gaming or even a phone call!","My biggest priorities for headphones is comfort, sound quality (both for music and phone calls), and noise cancellation.ComfortThe XM5’s have ear cups that are slightly larger than the XM4s and they also look slightly larger than the NC700s.","I think I’d give the edge to the XM5s because they block out ambient noise slightly better than the NC700s, but the difference is negligible.Noise CancellationI mean, these are high end headphones and both do a great job with noise cancellation.","But because of the superior noise cancellation and sound quality, I’m going to be using the Sonys from now on.","But, if you can get past a little sweaty ears, or if you use them indoors or on airplanes, you should be a little excited.The Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones feature, what Sony advertises, “industry-leading noise cancellation.” And they ain’t lyin.","These two processors control 8 microphones for crazy accurate noise cancellation.","But the over the ear closed design may help dull annoying sounds.A very small cadre of people claim they become nauseous using noise cancelling headphones, and especially the old model XM4s.","You start speaking, and the XM5s automatically adjust noise cancellation to pick up the voices of other people.","If you want 100% Noise Cancellation, use ear plugs that are made for it not a pair of Bluetooth Headphones.","Having Noise Cancellation with music playing does help focus more on the songs.","That being said, it does isolate my voice quite well in a loud environment and the Noise Cancellation keeps me from hearing anyone talk though to how high I have the volume playing my content to immerse myself.","But like I said, without any content playing you can still hear stuff through the noise cancellation but once you play something else on top it’s gold.","I hate having to use my phone to change a few things such as the level of noise cancellation or shutting off/on the gesture control.","I recently had to travel and ended up wearing them for 6 hours straight!Battery life: The battery was full and by the end of my travel it dropped to 85% so the battery life is outstanding.Noise cancellation: It was really good and didn’t create too much pressure while on.","Noise cancellation isn't as great as the

times and turns the noise cancellation down very suddenly when I’m listening in the car which is a bit startling but you can turn this feature off.","Maybe I just didn't know what to expect out of

airpods pro, big sound leakage, noise cancellation is also similar to airpods pro.","The noise cancellation is 100% best-in-show.","I had a previous version of the Sony WH-1000XM5, and was excited to buy what I thought would be the best active noise cancelling headphones available today, despite their $400 price tag.","I'll have to say that the active noise cancelling is fantastic.","Continues on a bit of a muddy sound like the previous models, however the noise cancelling is superb and EQ options such as the custom Wavelet profile from soundguys make this an incredible all around headphone.Edit: After owning this for a few days I've noticed some issues.","Adaptive noise cancellation kills ANC capabilities.","Noise cancelling is awesome.","Cumbersome when compared to other noise cancelling headphones as well as HUGE case.","Many other higher-end noise cancelling headphones utilize the tilting headphone as the on/off activation which is easy, efficient, and preserves the battery.","The only thing these headphones really have going for them is their noise cancelling ability and battery life are good.","Through sweat & wind then noise cancellation held and the music was clear","If I'm across the room from my phone or computer, I want to be able to mute my microphone without having to walk across the room and search for the mute button on the program that I'm using.This is apparently a long running issue with Sony devices like this.These headphones are not good for use on phone calls, Zoom or WebEx meetings, or Slack Huddles because of the lack of a mic mute feature.The included microphones are mostly for accommodating the noise cancellation rather than for spoken conversation.Check out headsets from Poly/Plantronics for use with voice communication.I will likely return these headphones.","I like the compatibility of apple products but wanted great noise cancellation so I chose these.","Can confirm that the sound is great, noise cancellation is great, but I just could not wear these for more than an hour.","The noise cancellation is superb and it's very soft on the ears.","The pressure from the noise cancelling can cause me

down one of the best Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) Technology-Lightweight and Comfortable (for X amount of hours)-Excellent Battery LifeCONS-Build Quality feels Cheap and Fragile-Earpads can Deform, get Hot (sweaty), and become Uncomfortable-Flimsy Case-PriceyOh wow!","The Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) in this headphone is simply one of the best in the market.","The sound quality is just excellent and the noise cancelling is top notch.","They'll turn right back on once I push the button, but multiple times now I've been mid-YouTube video, and they just...turn off.By far my biggest complaint, though, is the weak noise cancellation.","The low-quality noise cancellation is inexcusable given the cost of these, so they're definitely going back, and I'd recommend many other products over these, to be honest.","I've been very impressed with the audio quality so far.Noise Cancellation is good, but considering the use the same sensor as the last generation (XM4's had a single processor for this, XM5's have 2 of that same sensor), I was expecting a lot more sound to be canceled out.","I don't think it's a fair assumption, but I was honestly assuming that with double the processors I'd see double the noise cancellation and that didn't really appear to be my experience.","You do get \"more\" noise cancellation, but I don't think it's twice as good.","The XM4's were already impressive to me with their noise cancellation, so these do not disappoint, I think I just got a bit suckered by the marketing of \"now double the processors\" here!","There are minor differences in the noise cancellation but both are excellent and I’d be fine with either of them.","I tried the Bose from a less expensive to the most expensive and to be honest The Sony WH-1000XM series, from XM2 through the latest XM5's are the hands down absolute best from noise cancelling, sound quality and comfort.","I sometimes even wear them to sleep, though I wouldn't recommend that.Noise cancellation and sound quality: these definitely seem to be a notable improvement in noise cancellation over my previous XM3s, and with similar NC but better sound quality, compared to the XM4.","And they also have Sony's excellent noise cancellation — every bit as good as Apple's or Bose's for travel, though it lacks a bit if you are a fan of \"transparency\" mode — along with easy, ultra-fast USB-C charging.","You certainly can't fault them on sound, noise cancellation, or convenience.","Best sounding headphones I’ve ever used with the best noise cancellation.","I also tried the Bose 700’s, which sound great but the noise cancellation has a weird vacuum effect…the XM5s don’t have that.","Yeah, the noise cancellation is great while traveling on a plane…but even when you’re just listening to music around the house, the noise cancellation silences any ambient noise and makes it feel like you’re right there in the music studio.","In this app you can also set your EQ functions for the headphones with options for more base or more treble etc.One of the features I really love is the noise cancelling functionality as I was walking outside and having cars zoom by and even walking my dog around the noisy city the headphones were able to block out a lot of the noise and hear my music clearly.","Sound quality, noise cancellation, and comfort are all amazing.","Noise cancelling is great and works very well8.","Noise cancelling quality is amazing.","Really works around 30 hours on single charge with noise cancellation on.","Good :Active noise cancellation is fantastic!Fast charging is good, bluetooth connectivity is fine!The call quality is amazing.The app shows the SPL levels and it's effects on hearing which is awesome!Bad :360Reality Audio is a gimmick, should've had AptX HD, AptX Adoptive along with LDAC because with LDAC you cannot connect two devices at once.The outer plastic cladding near the foam pads push the frames and makes it a bit uncomfortable (those with specs are better off with XM4).Ugly:The sound quality is good when you don't EQ , but if you use their own apps EQ it's good only upto 70% once you increase the volume beyond it starts to distort and once you turn it all the way up the EQ just flatens and sounds like hot garbage.I don't hear beyond 60-70% volume but even if i want the volume to go to max the SPL doesn't go beyond 99db with any codec I've tried LDAC, AAC, SBC with their upscaler DSEE Extreme no change whatsoever.Also the change in volume beyond 70-75% is really not much and infact the headphones only start to distort!","The noise cancelling is great for frequencies like those of a fan or jet engine.","Now my main reason for buying these was because I'm going on a plane next week and needed something that was noise cancelling as i have sensory issues but was also looking for a new daily over ear headphone.","Coming from Skullcandy crusher evos, i obviously understand these are geared towards being a noise cancelling headphone and not a bass headphone, however I expected more for $500 of my own money.Additionally, these headphones don't fold and come in a larger case than 90% of other headphones out there.","Seriously Sony who thought of the no folding design?While they're very light and comfy, have great noise cancelling for certain frequencies, contain amazing call quality, have 30-40 hrs of battery and the touch sensors on the right ear cup are SUPER fun and easy to use, I would not buy these if you're also expecting great sound.","Noise cancellation doesn't work correctly in all noise conditions.It is not at all near bose experience.","I did not like them at all, their noise cancellation is not good, what is that the material of the headphones is of very good quality but I do not like it","I like the sound quality and noise cancellation.","This is my favorite one by far.I travel a lot and mostly use these when travelling, for conference calls on the fly, music, tv shows, noise reduction on the plane and so on and it’s simply perfect in all these aspects:- Sound quality is very impressive- Noise cancelling is top of the field- Voice clarity for the microphone on my calls is perfect for my coworkers- Syncing is a breeze- Controls are easy to get a handle onVery very satisfied with this acquisition.","This headset has outstanding features such as touch control, noise cancelling, it's cordless, rechargeable and it comes with a collaspable case with magnetic storage for the headset wire and Type-C USB charger.","These are amazing headphones  especially because I need to wear them all day for work calls, as i need to take calls while I work, good noise cancellations.","The noise cancelling is excellent as always, definitely helped out by the better seal of the new pad material, and transparency mode is better, albeit not as good as the Airpods Max.Cons: While I enjoy and understand the use-case for noise-cancelling audio tech, there are several choices about the XM5 that I have to question about Sony.","Great sound quality and noise cancellation.","The call quality is 100% as good as with a high end phone.Noise cancelling is great.","Summary:Very good noise cancellingTop notch sound performanceExcellent Bluetooth connectivityMore expensive than similar competitors, and even Sony’s previous generation XM4Does not fold into a compact shapeThe recently released Sony WH-1000XM5 (from now on I’ll just refer to them as the “XM5”) is the latest set of noise cancelling wireless headphones from Sony, building on the success of the previous model, the XM4.","The earcups do not fold inward to provide a more compact profile.There are 2 physical buttons on the left earcup, for power ON/OFF and Active Noise Cancelling ON/OFF.","Although the earcup padding seals out external sound fairly well, the headphones let you hear your own voice clearly by feeding it through the headphones.The noise cancelling works best on low frequency sounds, as is common with most NC headphones.","Sound is great, features and noise cancellation above mu expectations","A bit expensive but well worth it.30 hours of continuous use plus excellent noise cancellation.Also, does not disconnect or lose BT connection in crowded are with other BT be it in cars or headphones.","The headphones are perfect, with phenomenal noise cancellation, great sound quality and very comfortable.","The noise cancellation is first-rate, and about the best that I have seen to date.","One of the best noise cancelling headphones I have used.","I hadn't realized how much sound my refrigerator made until I got this.I have WF-1000XM3(the older ear buds) which supposedly have great noise cancelling, and having used them I can confirm they do that part well enough.","Noise cancellation is better than any I’ve tried and I work with high velocity dryers that are 108 DB and they just sound like wind in the distance.","If you own a XM4 already, you will be disappointed how poor the noise cancellation is on XM5.","With XM4, you would hear nothing on a plane when you put it on, but for XM5, the background noise is still there, you could definitely still say that it is noisey even after putting your XM5 on.Also note that, Sony have removed the control options for noise cancelling for XM5 which you have on XM4.Another thing, I really can't understand their logic why you would ever need less intense noise cancelling when the ambient is \"overall\" less noisey.","Good luck with your noise cancellation, your XM5s WILL decide that you are in a quiet place and only filter the tiniest noises (which you don't care about), but lets the noise which you would want it to block in.","Totally makes no sense to me.I want noise cancellation to just WORK, that's why I decide to put the headphones on in the first place, and no exception to quiter places.If Sony really needs to promote your adaptive BS for marketing, which is understandable, at least add an option to let your customers control how intense they want the noise cancellation, so your product can actually do the job.I am so disappointed with how the XM5 performs in so many ways, this is honestly so many steps backwards from the previous XM4 in my opinion (and yet more expensive).","XM4 can be set to use maximum noise cancellation settings to make a normal room quiet like a library archive room.","I bought XM5 expecting stronger noise cancellation because it should be able to do so based on the testing results I read online.No.","the \"automatic\" noise cancellation ruined its experience for me.","It is incredibly annoying to be sitting in a busy area working and then have the ANC turn to a lower power or completely stop noise cancelling.","Love these - amazing noise cancelling features, the sound quality is great and they're perfect for my very loud work environment.","If I have to give full mark, I will give it for noise cancellation(10/10) ,sound quality is also good as well as Bluetooth connectivity.","Very effective, perfect noise cancellation, great sound quality and battery lasts forever.","The VA will guide you on the further steps)- The Noise Cancelling (Bummer), The sound (Play the 360 Spatial Audio video on YT)- Volume at 60% should be enough for most people to enjoy the music.- Extremely comfortable to wear for long durations and these charge really fast.- The Bluetooth range is good enough to roam around a duplex without worrying about fades.- The app gives enough customizability freedom.","Sound better than my Bose and the noise cancelling is great.","Has a faaaaaaaaaaaar better noise cancellation.","This thing dynamically goes out of noise cancellation as soon as your head or jaw moves.","But it’s sooooooooo annoying.XM2 was far better in noise cancellation.And the sound quality?","The noise cancelling is amazing.","They do noise cancelling really well.","Noise cancelling is better than the XM$ at eliminating sound I used to get on the XM4 You'll get the same battery life as the XM4 also.","Extremely comfortable and excellent noise cancellation.","The noise cancellation works really well and I can barely tell they are on my head.","Noise cancellation is grade A when it's powered on.But the constant connectivity issues forced me to return it.","They squeak and scrunch with the tiniest motion of the head, destroying the purpose of noise cancellation.","The noise cancelling was good but the mic I wanted mostly for both Koch and noise cancelling.","The noise cancelling performance on this headphone is outstanding.","The noise cancellation is lovely!","I love that you can control the degree of noise cancellation and choose to focus on voices or the environment!","For noise cancellation, they do a mediocre job when it comes to predictable noise (e.g fans or lawn mower).","To me, these seem like the noise cancelling is not that great.","The noise cancellation is incredible.","I cannot believe how good the noise cancelling capability is.","These try hard and the noise cancellation is great, but the 360 sound is weak and just off..I got them for work, but the mics and connection did not do well with the limited use I did.Not bumming!The warning says no sweating lol, no problem these will fall of your head well before a sweat is broken, annoying.","First let’s start of by saying I’m seeing so many positive reviews by people who never owned the xm4 or previous models they sound like promo reviews by SONY if you ask me, so you can understand the frustration by people who have owned previous models, first let’s start with noise cancellation which is awful on the xm5 no manual adjustments to the noise cancellation, and the auto noise cancellation optimization is a zonk on this generation Sony you took something so simple and nice and just messed it up, taking phone calls with these headphones were great and battery life is always awesome with the XM LINEUP,  now let’s start with the clamping force on this one I find myself having to lift the headphones off of my head because the feeling is so tight never had an issue with the XM4, the build quality on this one feels okay and the touch controls are much faster and responsive on this generation, the ability to not fold on this generation is a zonk to me as well but it looks like Sony is going in this direction so this would have some getting used to as they are following the other competitors with their designs as well, sound quality is great not excellent as everyone has their own methods and ideas as to what good sounding headphones are, until the noise cancellation is fixed, clamping force and more comfortable pads I don’t see the reason to try to like these headphones because they are the newest thing out, these manufacturers are putting out junk and not ready products at the cost of my wallet","The sound is clear and the noise cancellation is on top.","The noise cancellation is top notch.","The only thing is that the automatic noise cancellation turns on by itself even if you manually turn it off in the app.","I've been using XM3 for about 4 years now.I skipped XM4 as I heard it's not much better than XM3.As for XM5, as I heard it's got phenomenal features, so I wanted to give it a try.For sound quality, it is definitely alot better than XM3-Its directional sound is noticeably better than that of XM3,And music/movies/games just sound so much better.Some of the really cool feature it's got are speak to chat and multiple connection features.Speak to chat allows me to talk to someone freely without taking off the headphones.Multiple connection feature allows me to switch from my PC to my phone instantly when I get a call, or play a video on my phone.As for noise cancelling, XM3 seems to have better ANC.I thought I was able to hear more noises when wearing XM5, but it didn't seem that far off.My biggest disappointment was its comfort.Due to playing video games on a daily basis for long time, I sometimes wear the headphones for 8~12 hours.","I would assume that a lot of people would like these headphones but I do like some bass and the mx4's do much better in that aspect.In terms of professional use, these come closer to the Airpods Max able to deliver excellent noise cancelling with passable transparency mode.Since I do have the Airpods max however, I didn't need another pair of headphones for professional use.","They sound AMAZING (Sony's rich and full sound is unmatched).They are SUPER lightweightThe noise cancelling is BETTER than the Apple Airpods max headphonesVery nice travel caseThe only reason I returned them is even on their smallest adjustable setting they were too big for my normal sized head.","Overall decent headphones but very buggy I had to disable the features such as pause to remove and the adaptive noise cancelling.Would I recommend.","Unless someone understand the bugs still in them I would not recommendPros* noise cancelling is awesome* the mic quality is exceptional.Cons* Very buggy on the movement around standing sitting, removing headphones and stopping* Newer firmware has partially address some problems but its still not perfect and needs more refinement.","It's not perfect, but it is the best noise cancelling I've yet experienced.","Pricey but incredible sound, great noise cancellation and comfortable to wear.Only drawback is they don’t fold down like the previous Sony headphone models.","Hands down Sony blows Bose away in all categories - noise cancellation, music quality (with a great app to adjust settings for t ypes of music, my music is spiritual and has a wide range from instrumental to vocals, and lastly I love the adaptive noise cancellation feature on these headphones.","However, the bass is really good and doesn't muddle the rest of the music.The noise cancellation is incredible.","There is a HUGE change in what you hear with and without the noise cancellation.","But the sound quality and noise cancellation is perfect for my school trips so I’ll be keeping them.","Noise cancellation is superb!!","The noise cancellation was not great it wasn’t that noticeable, and the ear cups didn’t have any cushioning to it so it wasn’t that comfortable.","The noise cancellation isn't great if you wear glasses (the gap opened by the glasses basically removes the noise cancellation).2.","I can wear them for hours without discomfort, the noise cancellation is not perfect, but it's better than these Sony XM5s, and the design is so much easier to manage and travel with.","The only few noticeable upgrades would be the noise cancellation and the new design.","These are the best headphones on the market the  noise cancelling and sound is amazing.","To test the noise cancellation I turned the sound on about 1/3 volume and my dad spoke to me and I could not hear him.","The noise cancelling is way too good.","Not sure if it was just the one I got but the noise cancellation was no where to be found.","I thought by buying 400 USD headphones I would be blown away.Noise cancelling is nice, but, audio is as good as my 40 and 80 USD headphones from SoundCore and TaoTronics.Noise cancelling might be a little better, but definitely not worth spending 5-10 times what I had with my other headphones.I travel a lot so I thought, I'll pay a premium price to ensure I minimize any outside noise when on a plane or a bus, but it has come with a lot of problems.It pairs with my Win 10 computer, but, audio dissapears every now and then and I have to connect and disconnect.Would definitely return the product if I could, I'm overseas and these are headphones are trouble makers.","The XM5’s (even with adaptive sound control off), seems to toggle the noise cancelation up and down in different environments instead of just keeping the noise cancellation at high.","The headphones are so amazing, but there's a \"feature\" called auto noise cancellation optimization that will completely randomly change the level of noise cancellation on the headphones, making the noise cancellation completely useless at times.","The second thing is that if you use them with speed outside (running, really windy out, or a bus/car window is open) then the wind will fill up the noise cancelling sensors and cause some pretty loud and odd sounds.","Why can’t I just crank the noise cancelling all the way up myself?","My much much older 1000xm2 headphones seem to have stronger noise cancelling.","entirely disappointed in overall sound quality and the features stop at noise cancellation.","Best noise cancelling headphones you can get.","I was wondering if they were loud enough for me in the gym… but they are loud enough to blast over subwoofer strength music AND completely drown it out with noise cancelling technology.","Great product with best noise cancellation","The noise cancellation is excellent and the sound quality especially when u listen to music it is totally worth buying.","I never had noise cancelling headphones and i was stunned when i experienced that feature, but when someone is talking to me i can hear them clearly without hearing the machine in background!","The noise cancellation beats the Bowers Wilkins headphones I previously used.","Other than this, the noise cancellation is top notch.","Also, one of its best features is that it detects your movement and adjusts your setting accordingly, which we can choose from ambient sound, noise cancelling.","Excellent noise cancellation.","Great noise cancellation, sound and comfort, better than XM4.","I would have gotten a deal if the headset actually appeared to look \"new\" according to Amazon's description.The ear cup padding on the headset was faulty, and the noise cancelling didn't even work, even when I paired the headset to the app.","This continued happening throughout the day.Big issues: The noise cancellation is embarrassing  bad on my unit.","Unfortunately I think my unit is either defective or the software is broken considering the very inconsistent performance among users and my pair’s almost complete lack of any active noise cancellation.If possible I would like to speak to someone about this and get my issue resolved because I so badly want to daily drive these headphones.","Noise Cancellation is average.","Noise cancellation is good.","Couldn't believe how good the noise cancelling is!!","You can just put these on your head and just have the NC on to get in your bubble.Pros:Really beautifulInsane noise cancellingGood touch controlEasy pairing and you can pair with 2 devices.","Sound quality is great and the noise cancelling is some of the best I’ve tried.","I can study so much better with these by turning on noise cancelling.","ANC isn't consistent either, it would often feel like the amount of noise cancelled is changing.","Had to switch to this model because XM3 is becoming very hard to findI don't understand the glowing reviewsIt's a step down on the WH-1000XM3 in possibly every way except battery life, which was already long enough to begin withThe padding is much less comfortableBass was apparently balanced and boosted by someone who's deaf to lower frequenciesSize adjustment is needlessly fashionable yet unpracticalMuch more sensible to internal sound from your mouth, or the jack cable touching anythingThe right earphone touchpad sensitivity is ridiculously high, to the point it activates on its own at randomBut worse than all this, while my XM3 models died from the right earphone basically frying out in noise cancelling mode, and what do you know, the XM5 already has right earphone issues barely 1 week after purchase, as opposed to 2 yearsRandom crackling, \"underwater\" audio, issues which can only be fixed by... slapping the earphoneNeedless to say it's not going to last long at this rateAt that price mark this is practically a bad joke and a scam","Great noise cancellation and great sound.","Deep bass even at low volumes.Top notch noise cancelling; I can’t even hear my young children fighting with each other while we are in the same room.Worth every penny if you are a dad like me in need of a little peace and quiet time to yourself for an hour or so on the weekend.","Casual listening…jazz, classical, rock…The best quality sound with noise cancelling.","The a massive difference between noise cancelling and normal mode.","The noise cancellation is just superb - way ahead of the Bose I just replaced with these.","Great noise cancellation and sound(once you use the equalizer).","Noise cancellation is excellent.","The noise cancellation is amazing!!","Neither there is an option to use the usb c, since it’s only charging but is not usable while doing soNoise cancelling “adaptive” is unreliable, let me adjust it manually, what the hell happened sony?","It also has a long range.5) Long battery life and charges fast.6) App features/options - Several options for customizing EQ settings, noise cancellation, transparency, and so on.7) Multiple device connectivity8) I adore the color Sand (white).9) Sound Quality.","I wear my headphones every day for at least five hours a day, so they're a worthy investment in my book because the noise cancellation improves my quality of life (apartment living, etc.","The noise cancellation is definitely better on these than the X4.","Best sounding headphones I have ever bought and the noise cancelling is really nice!","returned as noise cancellation is broken","Best in industry noise cancellation.","But people got to be a little more realistic about the noise cancelling.","The sound quality is good and noise cancellation is excellent .","The noise cancellation is phenomenal.","Great headphones with outstanding noise cancellation!","Pros:Great noise cancellation.Great microphone quality.Cons:The sound signature tries to be a jack of all trades but master of none.","The noise cancellation is so good that I forget about my surroundings.","I can't speak to the noise cancelling or the sound because the discomfort of these headphones overshadows all of that.","The noise cancellation works extremely well and the sound quality is incredible.","The sound is amazing and the noise cancelling is better than the QC35s.","I’ve had them not even 20 minutes and the sound quality/noise cancellation has improved drastically.","Your experience is much more likely to mirror those than the negative reviews.Amazing noise cancellation, great sound quality, and comfortable enough to wear for hours at a time.","Quite an upgrade from the xm4sBetter sound and noise cancelling but the new case sucks.","Noise cancelling is the best I've ever tried.","I’ve been rocking AirPod Pro’s and decided to jump into the new XM-5’s -largely because of Flossy Carter’s rare “quad major go”, but after three days with them, I have to said that the noise cancelling isn’t nearly as good as the Air Pods.","I have The noise cancelling on max setting, good ear cup seal, and I hear running water and people talking quietly next to me.","Noise cancellation and sound quality and EP as advertised!","I also have \"silver\" hair so the white blended in nicely.My only beef with these is the adaptive noise cancelling.","Then, for no reason at all, the noise cancelling cut out and I heard all of the ambient noise.","After about a minute the noise cancelling turned on again.","TL;DR: *ALMOST* plug and play, noise cancelling second to none, amazing sound quality.These are the first expensive headphones I have ever purchased, and I must say, never have I experienced music like this before.","Only when it is paired with it's noise cancelling feature do you stop and listen to things that weren't there before.","The noise cancelling feature can take a little to get used to (couldn't last more than 5 minutes without any music and NC on) but it is well worth it.","All in all, if you're looking for some quality headphone that will get you through that midnight flight, look no further.The only negative note that I could find is that initial setup may be a little bit tedious to get it just the way you want it (Account, Assitant, Noise Cancelling, Ambient Sound, linking music provider, Adaptive  control?, and a bunch of other stuff).I know there are audiophiles out there who will tell you to get \"X\" brand because they're so much better or so much cheaper.","The sound quality and noise cancelling are very good and, if you don't have big ears, they're very comfortable.","Noise cancellation is fantastic!","Waiting on the tarmac or at the gate the noise cancellation worked flawlessly.","I use noise cancelling headphones to make my plane time more peaceful and enjoyable.","I will say right up front, I just couldn't hear any difference in the noise cancelling from my M4's.","PERIOD!Excellent work, Sony!ps my previous headset - Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700","When I first got these I looooved them, sound quality is amazing on these and I love the touch controls as well as the noise cancellation.","There is nothing  I found in their Android app to fix this problem.The headband in narrower than the XM3/4 and therefore more uncomfortable.For the price, seriously Sony, you couldn't add a bigger battery and/or wireless charging?The XM5 anc (noise cancelling) wasn't that much better and it was actually a little worse than the XM3/4 when it came to the dreaded landscaper's two-stroke buzz buzz test....Definitely not worth $400, and not even $350 if you already have an XM4.","I needed headphones with the following features:- Noise cancelling: extraordinary on these headphones- Mic that is usable for Zoom/phone calls: the mics on these headphones are perfect, at last, and I've tried out every other set for sale including the Sony predecessors, whose mics were horrifying- 3.5mm jack: essential for work which requires there to be no audio latency.","2.5mm jacks (Bose, etc) are useless.- Able to be used when battery dead: these headphones can do that!Finally, the perfect noise cancelling over ear headphones!","The noise cancellation is exceptional.","Fit and feel is good.Regarding the noise cancellation, I actually started taking these outside to mow the lawn.","New XM5 compared to XM4+Noise Cancellation+Call Quality+Battery Life+Charging Speed+Ambient Sound (Close to real sound)+Slightly More Comfortable+Many more minor improvements in hardware and softwareYou can reach me at my Insta for any information- imtiyaz.azhar","I have a big head, the XM5 fits more comfortably than the XM4 did, and seems to have better noise cancelling.","However, I will be sticking to wired headphones with good passive noise cancellation.","Grate noise cancellation.2.","Very comfortable feeling.The noise cancelling level is just on and off, there is no manual level adjustment.","I have a pair of $60 noise cancelling headphones that can be registered to any number of devices, so I know it can be done.","I would recommend finding a store that has the various models and trying them out before deciding, as the older models are quite a bit cheaper and might be a better choice if you don’t need the little bit extra noise cancellation you get with these.","Great sound quality and superb noise cancelling.If I have to pick a downside: the p2 cable port doesn't carry microphone audio :(This is the best phone you can by as for Feb, 2023.","Noise cancellation, sound quality are all good, what you'd expect from this series and at this price.","Up until now I’ve just bought cheap Monoprice headphones and the noise cancelling was laughable.This morning my wife walked out and said “Who was at the door?” I said “what do you mean?”She said some guy rang the doorbell a few times and was yelling at our front door.","Didn’t hear a THING.So A+ on the noise cancellation.And I am fine with the touch panel for volume control etc.I’m also a big fan of the speak to chat function.","They are soft and comfortable, great sound quality, and the noise cancellation is unmatched.","Noise cancellation is fantastic.","I bought these for a trip to Japan and I must say the noise cancellation and sound quality are excellent.","After activating noise cancellation all the background noise drops away and you can hear the audio you are listening to very, very well.","No clue what causes this...but I don't think I can recommend these headphones anymore.ORIGINAL REVIEW (**** out of *****):I recently upgraded from the xm4 to the xm5.I had several issues with the previous version (main one being their flawed, slow multipoint BT connection which caused more frustration than the headphones were worth) but some things they implemented on these xm5s are a bit of a head scratcher.PROS:Great sound qualityGreat noise cancellingGreat fit/comfortLong battery lifeSlimmer and less bulky than xm4Better, but not great, multipoint Bluetooth connectionDouble click for spotify is awesomeCONS:Multipoint - still has issues and I have to restart either the headphones or the device it's connected toNot compact/No longer collapsable like xm4 - bummer for travelingHeadphone case is ok but much prefer the xm4 caseThe multipoint was so awful on the xm4 I gave up on them out of sheer frustration.","Both the noise cancellation and sound are amazing.","Noise cancelling is still very annoying, I'll hear all the sound around me till it decides to kick in and block some of it.","With no way to adjust the amount of Noise Cancellation happening, the M3's I've been using has better blocking on some occasions.","The noise cancelling worked just fine.","Great noise cancellation and love being able to use the touch/tap features.","Noise cancellation is top tier no doubt about it when I'm commuting in the city or on a train.","Between the simply noise isolation of the headphones then the active noise cancelling there is very little outside noise audible when I'm listening to music on these headphones.","Doing activities such as school work with the active noise cancelling helped me get so much work done with little to no distractions.","Other than that the noise cancelling and the easy access control are all nice","The sound quality on them is very good for bluetooth noise cancelling headphones and the Sony app offers a good amount of customization of the learning experience.","The XM5s are also hotter and less comfortable to wear over long periods of time.My other problem with them is that the noise cancelling is a bit too smart with the automation.","The noise cancellation is top tier and the sound quality is amazing but there are some really terrible flaws.","Sound, noise cancellation, ergonomics, touch interface (on the headphones), Android app, carrying case are each great on their own.","If your device doesn't support LDAC at 660 or 990Kbps and you're not planning to upgrade soon, then you may be just as happy with Bose QC35 ii and save yourself a few hundred bucks.Along the same lines, if you don't need active noise cancellation, you may be just as happy with something like VModa Crossfade 2 and have quite a few extra buckaroos left over.Minor gripe: matte black finish tends to show some fingerprints, but they're generally easy to clean off.","The former has excellent noise cancellation and the latter is the all-round pair with my favourite sound without noise cancellation.Noise cancellation seems on par or slightly better than Bose QC35, which is saying a LOT.","This noise cancellation also does miracles on aircraft.","You can definitely save some money if you're willing to compromise in the area of noise cancellation or sound but I also think it's pretty easy to justify these Sony's if you have long commutes on public transit and especially if you have long flights.","This particular headphone requires no introduction so I'll get right to it; noise cancellation is pretty good but far from perfect but it is significantly improved in comparison to XM4, overall comfort for me is lacking in comparison to XM4, touch control and other features are noticeably better for me particularly the touch control accuracy.","It supports SBC/AAC/LDAC audio codecs.≡ Noise cancellationNoise cancellation works fairly well for the most part and it ain't noticeably better than XM4 for me personally and it heavily depends on the source of the ambient sounds, particularly the frequencies and I feel that its adaptive/auto noise cancellation does NOT work as well as I want it to be in a particularly chatty environment.","In any event, its noise cancellation capability is amongst one of the best but it's unlikely to work in at all times for everyone (or even most people) because sound perception is highly personal.≡ FeaturesFeature-wise, it's got a similar set of features as XM4 but with minor improvements.","I wasn't extremely excited about the performance at the beginning, but after I took some time to adjust the settings, I am blown away by its outstanding sound clarity, noise cancellation, and smart functionality, so be sure to play around with the settings to find what suits you the best.","The app has multiple features and options to customize and change the EQ settings, the noise cancellation/ambient noise and a feature that I find really interesting: adaptive sound control, which automatically changes between noise cancelling and ambient noise setting depending on where you are/what are you doing.","The faux leather does get a little greasy from your hands & ears but a moist towel usually will do the trick!I think the standout feature of the XM5s are the ANC and noise cancelling.","The noise cancelling doesn't have the weird buzzing or hum that I have noticed other people sometimes complain about with other headphones.","The noise cancelling however is top tier and completely nullifies most noise which is amazing when doing work.In conclusion, these headphones were a league above earbuds in terms of sound quality, comfortability, ANC and NC.","There are multiple presets, but I set mine as a custom to fit my taste.The noise cancellation is incredible.","I like the auto sensing feature where it turns on the hear-through when I'm moving and as soon as I stop/sit down it turns on the noise cancellation.","By no means am I a connoisseur of all things headphones, but you don’t need to be an expert to recognize that this is an excellent pair.The noise cancellation feature is flawless, which is the most important part in my opinion.","They’re perfect for sitting at your desk all day, but if you want to take these while travelling or even on your daily commute to work, they aren’t as conveniently portable as they would be if they folded.Overall, this is a very high-quality pair of headphones that provide excellent noise cancellation, both when listening to audio as well as when using the microphone for a call.","Love the simple hand controls on the right ear piece, swipe to change song, volume control, mute sound, etc...  great noise cancellation.","The function to pause the music when I speak is great and the voice-focused noise cancellation very useful.","I need silence, I didn't realize that the  microphone is also dealing with the noise cancellation too.","-noise cancellation is wildly good-comfort is incredible with the vegan leather-great sound quality-took a step back from MK4 with no folding design- carrying case, consequently, is bulky and harder to travel with-for $50 less, you're just about as well with purchasing the MK4's but these are great and I would recommend","The auto-noise cancellation optimizer is nice, overall I’ve had less issues with connectivity (i.e.","When comparing to the mx4 the sound is slightly but noticeably better, and same for the noise cancellation.","Sound, noise cancellation, build quality and comfort.","Noise cancelling is good.","These are perfect for what I need and I would recommend this to anyone who are looking for a pair of noise cancelling headphones :)","The audio quality is muddy, if audio is your priority look elsewhere such as Shure.If Shure had better noise cancelling I would much prefer them.I like clear precise audio with a flat response, these have reasonably tight bass, but far from clear.I have tried the soundcore, the bass is wildly uncontrolled, the Sony's are far suppiorior to the soundcore.I use the geadphones in the shop with many loud machines, the noise canlling is adequate.","This has amazing sound and noise cancellation.","Just wish directions were clearer in how to work noise cancellation!","They noise cancelling work so well that I'm now having to flicker lights to get his attention when I need to talk to him- he can't hear a damn thing with them on.","Noise cancellation: +Sound quality: +Volume control: +These headphones are great!","Great Noise Cancelling, Good Sounds Quality.","She loves it and says fantastic sound quality and noise cancellation.","To say I’m satisfied is a bit of an understatement.Noise Cancellation: Absolutely wonderful.","Depending on how much you use Noise Cancellation, the volume of playback, and of course the duration of playback.","I had to buy a longer one just so I wouldn’t have to charge the headset on the floor.Special “Cool” Extra: The free downloadable phone app that enables you to customize features of the headphones (update the firmware, equalizer, Noise Cancellation settings, much more).","Even LDAC cannot transmit lossless audio quality.Overall, if you are after great noise cancellation with audio quality second on your list, these are for you!","Excellent noise cancelling, sound quality, and battery life.","The noise cancellation is far, far better in the M5 version.I miss the voice prompts of the M4.","BOSE's QC45 noise cancellation is better than SONY's, I can still hear the noise of children, but I can't hear it at all when I wear BOSE's QC45, but the sound quality of the headphones is very good.I'll keep it because I need a wired headset.","The audio quality and noise cancellation is insane.","Enhanced even further with noise cancelling on.Comfort: 100% can wear these for hours multiple days in a row with little to no ear pain.Battery: don’t have much to say because the battery lasts for hours and takes almost no time to charge.Case: perfect, well built case you can rely on.CONS:black headphones are hard to keep clean because they’re Matte textured so all oils (including natural skin oils) show up on these like a black marker.Not sure there’s a way to replace the ear cups if they get gross.There’s a little hole between the ear muff and the head band connection point that I am concerned could fill up with gunk over time, not sure these are remotely water proof because of this.Would recommend these headphones, but wait until they are on sale.","My name is Lindsey and my pronouns are she/her.When splurging on headphones this expensive, one expects perfect noise cancellation, however, one doesn’t receive perfect noise cancellation.","My fiancée bought a pair of $60 headphones that have better noise cancellation than these WH-1000XM5 headphones that claim to be state-of-the-art, however, the sound quality of these headphones is unmatched.","I have listened to many different headphones and these headphones are the best on the market at the time of writing this review.They’re also lightweight and easy to carry for travel since they come with a case; the user just has to turn the ear muffs and reduce the band length to fit the headphones in the case.Just because these headphones have great sound and are perfect for travel doesn’t excuse the terrible noise cancellation.","++PROS+++ Paired easily to both my phone and PC (individually)+ Using Tidal as a music service to get high quality audio - sounds awesome+ The fit is comfortable, even for long listening sessions+ Good battery life--CONS--- The noise cancellation is good, but could be better- Setting up the multipoint connection (PC/phone simultaneously) was not as intuitive","Excellent noise cancelling.","I have had no issue of any drop at all.5) Battery/Charging - Long enough and charges quickly6) App features/Options - Multiple options to customize EQ setting, noise cancellation, transparency etc.7) Multiple device connectivity8) Love the Sand (white) color9) Sound Quality - Last but not the least sound quality is amazing.","Noise cancelling and transparency modes are a night and day difference with respect to the 1000XM4s, but both are still excellent pairs of headphones.","Unmatched noise cancellation.","Noise cancellation quality is strong, mic clarity is improved, all of this is quite well known.Several flaws in usability makes the experience a bit deceptive:-You cannot charge while in a call, if battery run out, your out.","As soon as I enable noise cancellation, I get drowned in my music and get detached from my surrounding!","Sound great, just not liking the automatic noise cancelling feature switching itself at random","I love everything about these headphones -- noise cancellation, touch controls, transparency mode and sound quality.","The highly touted industry standard noise cancellation is far inferior to my airpods pro.","Despite the extra processor and microphones in the XM5 I found the noise cancelling inferior to my XM4 - especially for blocking out voices.","If Sony fixes the XM5 software I will certainly purchase the headphones again - but not in its current form.Update: the latest firmware 1.1.3 does improve the noise cancelling a little bit, but it’s still not as good as the previous XM4.","Most automatic/convenience features are nearly unusable.The noise cancelling works well for low pitched sounds, but does virtually nothing for higher pitched sounds, and cannot be adjusted.","When I wear these overpriced earmuffs with the noise canceling activated, as soon as I say a word out loud, the noise cancelling goes poltergeist and shuts everything off.Waste of hard-earned money.","The only thing that stops it is turning the noise cancelling all the way off.As an aside, I bought the Dekoni earpads, which give you about an extra ¼\" of room for your ears and seal a bit better.","Things that have not worked so far include putting the headphones on a heating pad set to about 110°F overnight, wrapping them in said heating pad overnight, using a blow-dryer for 30 minutes (all I could stand w/o noise cancelling).My environment is not hot or particularly humid, I mostly am at 68 to 72° and 40 to 60%RH.I would give 4 stars for sound if not for this issue.They sound ok, but not as good as my big cans or my KZ ZSX & FIIO BTR5.","Noise cancelling has multiple levels which you DO NOT control, will change automatically, very unsettling.","And if you wear glasses the seal for noise cancelling is broken on and off CONSTANTLY.","Not worth the price previous generation sounds better in noise cancellation and volume control.","Noise cancelling is not that effective.2.","Noise cancellation is not able to stop TV voice, clearly I can hear TV noise with anc.4.","I wanted a pair of headphones for my game room but couldn’t find anything pink, noise cancelling and high quality worth the price.","They are so lightweight and have a great amount of noise cancelling.","Unfortunately I got these headphones for active noise cancellation and for inexplicable reasons sony has decided that they are smarter than the consumer and took away the ability to set the anc strength that the xm4s had.","My iPods have better sound without a subscription.As far as noise cancellation, it worked the first time.","I bought these mostly for the noise cancellation features and it hardly does anything for me.","The sound quality and noise cancelling are great, but I just can’t seem to get them loud enough.","The sound quality is pretty good, and noise cancelling is not bad, but Bose 700 does a better job.","Noise cancellation, sound quality, battery life all get a 5/5, the ability to recharge the battery in minutes and last for hours is a force to be reckoned with.","They have excellent noise cancellation, great sound quality and they are super light.","Noise cancellation is poor, doesn't work if you are moving.","Sony has downgraded from xm4.The only 2 good things in this headphones are fast charging and sound quality.Don't buy if you are looking for noise cancellation, comfortablity or upgrade from xm4.","absolutely exceptional noise cancelling.","The noise level at work is very loud and the first time I put these on I was amazed at the level of noise cancelling.","In terms of sound quality, I am not an audiophile but I feel this is the one area where they are at least equal, everything else is a wash.- Noise Cancelling.","I've also noticed this odd feeling when using noise cancelling, almost like a pressure on the inside of my ears.- Ergonomics.","Maybe the padding is too thin.Next, I immediately noticed the noise cancelling was not as good.","The sound is amazing, noise cancelling spot on, but the product manager blew it on one thing.","The noise cancelling is good, but banging pots and pans will still come through somewhat.","they are really heavy, not comfortable at all, The Sony WH-1000XM5, are very comfortable to wear, the battery last a long time, and you can pair them to 2 deceives at the same time which is a really neat feature if you are working in your computer and get a phone call, the sound quality is very impressive, the noise cancellation is good and ambient mode is descent ,  ambient mode is not as good as the airpods max, but considering everything else, I would go with this ones.","Bought noise cancelling headphones for my CPTSD (I’m sensitive to unpredictable sounds and I needed something to help me get through family gatherings for the holidays.)","The allergic reaction is the least concerned I could have for this.The noise cancelling for sure it is moderately improved over xm3 and the microphone results are amazing - It could not pick up my kid's crying right behind me.Too bad I cannot use this - my outer ear is getting red and swollen even after 2 hours of use.","At 6 months the noise cancelling started making a low bass rattling noise.","My \"daily driver\" headphones are in-ear Beats Fit Pro and AirPods Pro; wired Westone W40 (airplanes) - tried their wireless adapter and it's awful; and Bose QC35 ii (which for some reason has started to disconnect from my iPad Pro).Pros- Noise cancelling is absolutely the best for white noise (my AirPods Pro - latest firmware 4E71 - has lost 80% of noise cancellation - see online support/reviews for others' comments on this)- I can play music super low - like 5-15% of total.","Quirky, okay, but there are a lot of controls - and you can see Sony has improved it over the past 2-3 years with more functionality- Speak-to-pause works well (disables noise cancellation and you can talk with others).","Got them late due to neighbors.Review:Noise cancellation(10/10) are amazing the noice cancellation works very well.","But after listening to these new WH-1000XM5 headphones side by side with my XM4's and AirPods Max, I would say that the noise cancellation is slightly better on the XM5.","Noise cancellation improved a lot from predecessor XM4.Punchy base.Can listen long hours without damaging ear.","Excellent headphones with great sound quality and noise cancellation.","Other headphones that I have tried always used to apply constant pressure on my eardrum when noise cancellation was on, but this doesn't, and the noise cancellation is the best I've used to date.","Noise cancellation is best.","They are newer then the wh-1000xm4 yet seemingly don't work as well or at all.I had noise cancelling simply doesnt work.","These are absolutely not worth it when the main feature of noise cancelling just doesn't work.","I love the noise cancellation on these, and the sound is fantastic, or would be.","I purchased the headphones 2 months ago and have been able to use them for maybe 2 weeks total.The noise cancelling is great, bluetooth range is wonderful and the sound quality was originally awesome.","The sound and noise cancellation work great but the design is HORRIBLE compared to the XM4s.You can’t fold them, they smack together when you pick them up like the airpod pros I returned, they adjust with the slightest movement.","The design flaws are not worth the slightly better noise cancellation.Unfortunately I sold my old pair before receiving this new pair so I’m kind of stuck with them.","I took them to work and they were absolute trash in cancelling out louder than library level conversations.I tried out the Bose headset and I can say those headsets have far better noise cancellation but are not as comfortable as the XM5’s.I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT MY BEATS FIT PRO DID THE EXACT SAME JOB… BETTER.","Sprang for these because they were repeatedly rated highly, especially the noise cancellation.","Noise cancellation is not as good as my bose earbuds or apple airpods pro.","I also have a pixel 6 pro and it worked as expected with both.Battery - Same as the xm4 which is great.Noise cancellation - Great and slightly better than the XM4s.Overall I think Sony sacrificed portability which is where I put these headphones purpose.","Sound quality is amazing and the noise cancelling on an airplane is almost unbelievable.","They have good noise cancellation and ambient modes and are comfortable for medium periods of listening.","However,  Apple's AirPods Max has superior Noise cancellation, ambient modes and music reproduction in my experience.","The EAH-A800 are better at noise cancellation & ambient modes  and have great sound reproduction & best of all I can wear them for hours with no discomfort.","A comfortable set of headphones with outstanding noise cancellation and great battery life.","These headphones take that to the next level.Not only is the noise cancellation improved, it's location sensitive.","I find this feature a little gimmicky but it will dynamically figure out what kind of noise cancellation profile to use based on its app and manual overrides from you.","On a 9-hour overseas flight, I use 10% of my battery using the headphones continuously with the noise cancellation enabled.","With the 1/8\" plug, it works well with my gaming laptop with no lag and still having noise cancelling available.","I can't even hear the noisy (~60dB) fans on my computer with these headphones on.Noise cancellation is improved, but I did find it had some issues with (1) eating (where the jaw bone is moving the ear cups) and (2) moving your head side to side (getting some false noise readings where the surface is sound absorbent, like an airplane seat).","They're lighter, more comfortable, and have better noise cancellation.","The noise cancellation is no joke, I love them!","The noise cancellation and sound quality are superior to similar Bose headphones in my opinion.","Functionally, it is on par with the M3 and M4.Sound-wise, it sounds about the same - no complaints.The noise cancellation, however, is not as good as the M3 or M4.","You can be seated on a plane, turn your head, and suddenly the noise cancellation sucks because the headset is sampling the environment because it detecting a noise change when you moved your head.Worse still, I was on a noisy jet seated next to the window.","It checked all the boxes in terms of sound quaility, noise cancellation, and volume control, but it would slide off my head from the littlest of movement.","I do not think the Noise Cancelling on the XM5 is any better than the Bose QC35’S but definitely not worse.","I play PS5 and Switch and I need a jack port.The noise cancelling is GREAT, I hate noisy flights, I tried them first time and they are GOOD, I listened to music and watched Netflix shows and everything was perfect.For calls is great, you can control.everything with your right hand, sometimes the headphones unpaired with my job laptop (windows, I don't know if this is related to the operating system.Audio quality is beyond my expectations, I could hear my favorite and realized there were instruments I never heard.So far I have a great experience with the headphones.","Years ago, I foreswore Sony products because of their poor reliability, ridiculously proprietary nature, and bad service and support.While this product still has stupid proprietary bits (mainly in software), they can be safely ignored, and the device seems to work well with both my Android phone and my Linux computers.The headphones themselves are comfortable, have good battery life, and have much better noise cancellation with enormously more useful features than my old Bose Quiet Comfort 35s.","I was hoping that with all the hype the 1000XM5s would be substantially better than the AirPods Max.The biggest complaint is that when touching the ear cup on the Sonys you can easily hear it, the same action on the AirPod Max is minimal.Both headsets have excellent audio, with the Max edging out the XM5s.Controls -XM5 winsComfort - I prefer the Max but it is more an individual choice.Case - XM5Ease of use - MaxNoise Cancelling - Tie","They sound great but I think the noise cancellation option is better on the xm4.","Noise cancellation of the xm5 is actually outstanding good!BUT2.","Overall regret this purchase relative to bose.Pros:- Look good- Sound quality is OKCons:- Active Noise Cancelling is an absolute joke on these.","I did configure the app, and turned off the adaptive sound control so I ould keep Noise Cancelling always on.","Also unprompted, the noise cancellation would shut off and on.","The quality of sound, noise cancelling and Alexa features out performs the rest.","The noise cancellation is great and they are comfortable for me.","The noise cancelling stays on even if I tap or bump the headset now.","Hopefully a future update will let us leave the noise cancelling maxed like I was able to do with my old XM3 headset!","The noise cancelling is awesome.","Love the sound quality, noise cancellation is comfortable and it doesn’t feel like i’m in a vacuum, battery life is impeccable, mic is great (very good at voice isolation) and honestly they look so cute.","Coming from the AirPod pros the noise cancellation is noticeably bad, didn’t expect it from the supposed noise cancellation kings of headphones.","Couldn’t test noise cancelling or sound because they were enormous.","The noise cancellation was poor - it didn’t block out voices.","I bought them for household noise cancellation for sleeping but they do not cancel household noises.","A huge disappointment,and very poor design choices.How these got out into production is baffling.Absolute worst: the noise cancelling can't be set \"just On\".","The silly \"adaptive\" sound cancellation \"feature\" constantly causes noise cancellation to turn on and off, at roughly 10 second intervals.","Sony, PLEASE FIX THIS and allow it to just stay on full noise cancellation!","Best setting if coming from XM4's is ExcitedThey can be more comfortable and all but NC is way weaker than XM4's in trains and you CAN'T DEACTIVATE the \"Auto NC\".. not on the settings, not Ambient Sound, anywhere... You van set everything to Noise Cancelling but it still changes automatically MESSING UP THE EXPERIENCE.","Excellent build quality.Very good sound.LOUSY NOISE CANCELLATION!I returned them because of that.","Noise cancellation worksWell; sound quality best in class","The previous WH-1000XM4 had 1 Sony QN1 ANC processor with 4 microphones & it did an amazing job at noise cancellation!","XM5s we're marginally more comfortable, but not enough to make a difference to me either.The couple things that were much better was it's ability to auto pause when removing the headphones connect to 2 devices at once (XM3 doesn't have that), the ambient sound mode was so much better, and the headphones overall responsiveness to touch/button controls was much faster.As for noise cancelling, I'm convinced that there is variation in noise cancellation strength between each individual pair of WH-1000XM5 headphones.","So I know that objectively, the XM5s should have better noise cancelling than most competitors, especially the old XM3s.","The most important item to me was the noise cancellation.","The bass was better on the Bose headphones, but the noise cancellation was not there on the Bose.","Noise cancelling and transparency modes are a night and day difference with respect to the 1000XM4s, but both are still excellent pairs of headphones.","The noise cancellation, sound quality and battery life is amazing!","HOWEVER the main issue is, the Noise cancelling from the Microphones is non-existent.","ANC with no noise cancellation on mic is useless.","Amazing fit, very light, battery lasting close to 40 hours, amazing noise cancelling and transparency mode.","The sound quality is amazing and the noise cancellation is fantastic.","Ear buds fall out, leak sound and fail to provide adequate noise cancellation.","Comfort, hours of use, excellent sound, touch features, noise cancellation, no external sound leakage, ease of use.... the list goes on...","And the multi point function works flawlessly!Noise Cancelling is no doubt the reason to buy these headphones and it is best in class, but as with all noise cancelling headphones there are limitations.","For overall features and noise cancelling these cannot be beat!","My headphones were set to about the middle volume setting with noise cancelling turned on and I could not hear any of the airplane noise.","I ordered the Sony WH-1000XM5 after looking at a lot of noise cancellation headphones.","I already had a pair of Pro Ears Pro Mag Gold for hearing protection but wanted these to help focus on projects and be able to get some well needed sleep.These headphones reduce ambient noises very well but still enables me to hear when someone calls my name, even when sleeping.Pros:- Great if you rest or sleep facing forward- Pairs easily with iPhone and/or computers- Lightweight and comfortable- Easily adjust the head strap- Great if you need to block out room noises and focus on a projectCons:- Bulky and uncomfortable if you’re a side sleeper- Needs an introductory video on how to use the tapping features (pause noise cancellation to speak/listen to others)-There are multiple tapping features available for the headphones but I haven’t found any tutorials on how to make the best of themSummary:The Sony WH-1000XM5 noise cancelling headphones work great if you want them to focus on a project, listen to music or watch a movie however; if you’re a side sleeper and want these to help you block out noises so you can sleep I found these too bulky and they kept coming off.","I ordered these and a pair of Oro Sound Tild Pro headset and these outperformed the tild pro which had an actual boom mic and has amazing reviews for noise cancellation in the microphone.","I bought these because I had a gift card to spend and I wanted to get a full-size set of cans wit great noise cancelling (better than my airpod pro’s).","Noise cancelling took me by surprise.","This feature is very bad and makes the noise canceling quite weak and fluctuating often.Side by side comparison with the Xm4 and Xm3 shows that the noise cancellation is clearly worse!","The sound quality is better though, but for the price you’d expect the noise cancellation to be better than years old models.","The sound quality, the noise cancellation, the design and quality is just not up to par with the price that’s being asked for.","The noise cancellation is great, especially for over the ear headphones!","I love the customizability with them app, the quick switch to noise cancellation and ambient mode is awesome, and all the other features!","Ready for the best in class noise cancelling headphones with incredible sound profiles completely customizable?","We absolutely love using the latest and greater wireless noise cancelling headphones – I can easily say that both Sony and Apple make the best out there.","When stationary, they’re fine, but when walking around and tilting your head, they begin to slip off.Features: Winner Sony XM5Sony offers an headphones app accessible from the App Store or Google Play Store which allows you to heavily customize your XM5’s, from building a sound profile, selecting audio pre-sets, adjusting noise cancelling, transparency modes and a great deal more.The APM on the other hand, do not have an app of any kind, besides the ability to select audio pre-sets from the music app you subscribe to.Transparency Mode: Winner Air Pods MaxThe transparency mode on the APM is unlike anything else; I can have full conversations that sound natural.","I tested the XM5’s for calls and was satisfied with the results.Noise Cancelling: Winner Sony XM5When wearing the APM for a long period of time, my ears feel like they’re going to explode.","When I first purchased the APM on the release date, I could use the noise cancelling option for hours however, after over a year, I can no longer handle noise cancellation beyond 15 minutes it gives me severe ear pain and I must switch to transparency mode or take them off and break.The XM5’s on the other hand, do not cause me any pain, regardless of if I’m listening for 30 minutes or 2 hours.","During testing, I listened to music for a long period of time and watched a YouTube for an hour.I feel that prolonged listening to the APM using the noise cancelling feature caused my ears to become highly sensitive after using them for over a year, with a feeling of severe cabin pressure.","Also, the noise cancelling feature from the XM5’s don’t give me the ‘cabin pressure’ feeling found from the APM.","I'm sure there are better options but that's what I used.For the ANC (noise cancelling), XM3's were much better in 'my' experience.","If you use spectacles, you won't feel comfortable with these, even if you wear it above your spectacles - you will lose the pure noise cancellation quality as sound enters from the space caused by the spectacles.2.","Never had this problem with my two models that were both Sony Noise Cancelling Headphones.","Great quality sound and noise cancelling is top notch.","The noise cancelling on the Xm5's are 'adaptive' by default and you can't change or disable it.","Super soft, high quality and great noise cancelling!","This has happened to me several times while I was on the phone with someone!The sound quality and noise cancellation are amazing.","I prefer the noise cancellation that Bose has, but I wanted them specifically for listening to music and Sony is where it’s at in that aspect.","It is not hi res audiophile good, but it is not far off either.- Noise cancelling is greatI have PTSD and random system sounds really hurt me.","Battery life is amazing, but that is to be expected from any premium wireless over your headphones.The touch controls have a bit of a learning curve, but they are for the most part very good (I have one issue with them, but I will get to that later).The noise cancelling is amazing of course, but what is more impressive is the improvements made to transparency mode.","The Sony headphone is the best for both noise cancelling functionality as well as intuitive controls.","It allows you to carry on conversations by pausing the noise cancelling function, the right headphone controls sound lsvel, forward and back, and they are super light.","I use my headphones constantly so I needed something that would be able to have good audio quality, good call sound, good noise cancelling and somewhat functional.","Noise cancellation - While it is actually very good, the ear pieces move once and no more noise cancellation.I do have some pros as well, they aren’t all bad!1.","I think you would be able to find over the ear, noise cancelling headphones with less glitches and issues for a cheaper price.","Love is noise cancellation and gesture control.Good for music, video calls, emmersive experience.","Noise cancelling microphones ensure clear conversation even in a noisy environment.","When I was out walking and

great, sound quality is great.","Noise cancelling is pretty good.","Fantastic noise cancellation.","Sony had perfected the art of noise cancellation of late.","I was able to still hear everything with noise cancellation on.","I got these for their noise cancelling and ambient sound options.","I owned the xm4s, fell in love, pre ordered these.The noise cancelling makes it so I can be aware if my surroundings for safety but also listen to music in peace even in the loudest areas.Base got more kick I feel like.Use them all the time","Top of the line noise cancellation head phones - not bulky at all!","Noise cancellation is the best with these headphones and I’ve only had them for 10mins and already love them.","Noise cancellation isn't localized to your environment and auto traffic can't be targeted when I'm waiting for the bus.","I was a bit reluctant to spend this kind of money on noise cancelling headphones but my old Sony ones were stolen in my checked luggage (still fighting Delta over that) so I decided to upgrade.......best decision ever.","While pricey, they really are the best noise cancelling headphones I've ever owned, and I've had several sets of Bose.","I commute in NYC

perfectly.","I can see why this model was consistently near the top, the sound quality, touch controls, comfort, noise cancellation, battery life, are amazing!","Noise cancelling is amazing, sound quality and battery life are amazing too.","It feels to me that Mark 4’s lost so much of details in the sound quality, when you listen to this.ANC: Noise cancellation has been improved by a lot.They still cannot cancel noise to a 100%, but well, no headphones can do it yet, but it is the best of any headphone out there.","I really like the accompanying app that allows you to adjust EQ and indicates what noise cancellation mode it is in along with how much battery life is left.","While I was completely impressed with the superior noise cancelling, the terrible battery life and impossible audio controls (when connected to two devices), made me ship them back.","The Sennheiser noise cancelling and audio quality were fabulous.","4 hours in, the noise cancelling is on par with

did have to restart my computer to get Windows to send audio over the bluetooth connection, but that was an issue with Windows and not the headphones.- The headphones themselves feel of good quality and are super comfy for my average sized head.- The EQ you set in the app does persist when you connect to a different sound source.","They sound good enough (especially with some EQ), and are comfy enough, to have some background music playing for hours at a time while also cancelling out loud office talkers.","They are sufficiently set for walking around or hanging out, this protects you from losing suction without significant pressure on your temples and keeps these super light headphones EXTREMELY comfortable.","It's an even bigger deal with these as they'll adjust sound and I could see if suction was lost at an inopportune moment it could be...uncomfortable.RE: HairY'all, your hair is going to need to be out of the way.","Shares the same features like the XM5, not the same sound like over the ear obviously but also more marketed to those who goes to the gym and likes something more compact.Pros:Comfortable and lightweight!I don't ever have a complaint with what they have to offer when it comes to comfort.","These are better than BOSE in regards as to comfort.","I think the one thing that makes them comfortable also is that they are light.","Yes the ear cup cushions are comfortable but again when I place them around my neck it compresses the cushion to a point where it feels awkward after putting it back on.","My biggest priorities for headphones is comfort, sound quality (both for music and phone calls), and noise cancellation.ComfortThe XM5’s have ear cups that are slightly larger than the XM4s and they also look slightly larger than the NC700s.","For this reason, I would say that the NC700s are a bit more comfortable for long periods.","The XM5s are very comfortable, but after a couple of hours, I definitely start to feel them more than the NC700s.","I just wish they had the comfort and build quality of the Bose.","If you’re moving from Bose's Noise Canceling 700 or QuietComfort 45s, the new dual processors and 8 microphone array will provide some noticeable improvements, plus the dual Bluetooth sync, so they’re probably worth looking into.","My airpods were great for comfort,, but terrible for a full day of work, and the mic quality was not great for call applications that I use.So I did some research between these headphones and other over-ear headphones like AirPod Maxes, Bose QC.","I was mainly deciding between these and the AirPods since I use entirely Apple devices and went with the Sony's for price and supposedly good comfort.So here are my pros/cons after about 3 months with these:Pros:- I have a huge head and I generally have stayed away from over ear headphones for long periods of listening.","These are inarguably the most comfortable headphones I have ever used.","There is very little static noise but if you are listening closely it’s very faint.Comfort: These are so comfortable and lightweight.","There is very little discomfort.","When you have them laying on your neck it can be a little uncomfortable at least for me.","The fit is SO comfortable and lightweight you could wear them for hours without having any ear pain (I've literally fallen asleep wearing them).","Sure, ascetically the air max's look nice and they are definitely the \"it-girl\" accessory right now but the quality of sound and the weight/comfort of these truly is just so much better.","I'm very satisfied!COMFORT 5/5These Sony's headphones are really comfortable for me.","These headphones are as comfortable as my last Bose QC35.","Very comfortable as well, headphones can get a bit uncomfortable after a while.","For noise cancelation, no other headphone can beat this.The pad are very comfortable.","Going to these headphones these were much more comfortable for a longer sessions, which to me alone is worth the extra spending on these headphones.They're slightly better sound-wise than the xm4's but it's not anything most people would notice.","The headphone is very comfortable and the quality of sound is very clean and sharp","Apples do not, insanely comfortable and breathable for hours on end).","The headset has a tendency to move and completely fall off if you move your head too much.As for comfort, they're okay.","Not only do they sound great, have great noise canceling, are crystal clear for phone calls, and give solid performance for those late night gaming sessions but they are so light and comfortable you hardly notice that you have them on.","They are really comfortable to wear the thing on the eat cups are nice and plush","Very nice to look at, and comfortable to wear.3) Function - It has all the functions I loved with my old headphones with more sensitive and touch-friendly material on the  headphones which acts as a remote (forward, backward volume up /down/ pause/play, etc.","Great comfort, excellent audio quality (especially when using LDAC).","My only issue is that it’s uncomfortable.","First, they fit perfectly over my ears and are so comfortableSecond,  The sound quality is awesome.","Bought these for my partner, who adores them for their light weight, comfortable fit, good touch controls, good quality voice pickup for video calls, and excellent noise-cancelling ability.","Taps and swipes for managing volume, pause, tracks are so intuitive, I needed only to glance through the instructions and see \"hold and swipe\", and it made sense.So far first impression is great - you pay not for flashiness, but for comfort, quality and ease of use.","They’re comfortable to wear tooIf you do wear glasses, just keep that in mind.","This is a genius application, and you don't have to feel around the ear cup for buttons!The head band is narrower, and unfortunately, less comfortable than the XM4's.","I can't recommend these at their current price point, and would recommend that most folks who like the design stay with the XM4s, or buy those as they're much cheaper and more comfortable, although their ANC lags this pair's superlative capability.","It's also very comfortable to wear and my ears don't sweat.","Not sure why other reviewers aren't noticing this, unless my pair is defective.Second issue is headphones are a lot less comfortable, tighter on head, more \"clampy\" on my skull.","Phenomenal comfort and quality.","Many days the mall noise is uncomfortable without some ANC.","I sometimes wear them for several hours at a time and they are quite comfortable.","Less comfortable than previous models - but has higher performance.","Comfort is amazing.","Easily the best headphones I have ever owned.Pros:Best sound for the priceNice EQ settings (could be more advanced though)Clean & Modern DesignTop tier ANC (Noice Cancellation) (better than Airpod Max)Cons:Not as portable as XM4'sNot quite as padded as XM4, but still very comfortable to me (this is subjective)Pass through is not quite as good as Airpod Max (but remember ANC is better on XM5s)","I would put them on and already start to feel them pressing on my ears pretty uncomfortably.","Returned and got the Bose QuietComfort, immediate improvement.","The XM5’s have a much crisper sound, great bass, great mics and are much more comfortable than the XM4’s!","Headphones did not feel comfortable on my head, the above bar and ear cups did not secure properly.","And they are so, so comfortable.5/5Sensational!","Only issue I have is that for me, my ears stick out slightly more than maybe most, so these are pretty uncomfortable when worn for over an hour.","I’ve had pressure discomfort in one of my ears since using the anc functionality.","PROS-Perfectly Balanced Sound Signature (Subjectively better than XM4)-Hands down one of the best Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) Technology-Lightweight and Comfortable (for X amount of hours)-Excellent Battery LifeCONS-Build Quality feels Cheap and Fragile-Earpads can Deform, get Hot (sweaty), and become Uncomfortable-Flimsy Case-PriceyOh wow!","It cancels out external noise pretty well.The XM5 is lightweight and comfy but the earpads can get hot and sweaty after multiple hours of usage.","The earpads can also deform which is not ideal as it may affect the sound signature (due to loss of proper seal) and comfort.","I have a set of Bose QC35 II, Bose 700, and Airpod Pros, all of which outperform these (to my layman ears).I have used these for streaming music from my iPhone, watching some videos on social media, and a lot of YouTube studying (currently in exam prep, so the videos are primarily instructors talking - not anything very audio-intensive).These aren't as comfortable as the Bose 700s, but are comparable to the QC35s.","I love the AirPods but they can be quite uncomfortable at times, especially when watching in bed, so I wanted to try the Sony’s.","The Sony’s are definitely more comfortable than the AirPods.","There is some minor discomfort with the head band as some have noted but I found I got used to it quick and it doesn’t really bother me.Both headphones sound excellent for movies, tv shows and YouTube and I doubt I could tell them apart in their basic settings.","But the Sonys are definitely more comfortable and light weight.","I may keep both but ultimately I’m waiting for apple to release a more comfortable pair of AirPods.","If apple can put out a more comfortable pair with all the same features then that’s the no brainer answer for me.","Here are my two cents :Comfort:Sony XM5 felt lighter and more comfortable when wearing.","I also compared with the Bose Quiet Comfort 35, and 700 headphones, and Apple's AirPods Max.I sampled many types of music from CDs directly through a high-quality Sony Blu-ray disc player with a wire, then repeated with Bluetooth 5.0 using iTunes with ALAC Lossless without external amplification, and Amazon Music on the highest quality settings.Sony's DSEE Extreme is impressive at upscaling compressed digital files and seems to make even old MP3s sound better.","They are very comfortable.","I tried the Bose from a less expensive to the most expensive and to be honest The Sony WH-1000XM series, from XM2 through the latest XM5's are the hands down absolute best from noise cancelling, sound quality and comfort.","Comfort: I read about a lot of people saying these caused their heads to hurt; I haven't experienced any pain with mine, and I wear them probably 10+ hours a day.","Make sure to loosen them by extending them/pulling the headphones down from the headband, as it's easy to overlook this comfort feature.","Loosening them on days I have a headache or just want less pressure makes them plenty comfortable.","I bought these to accompany my MW75 and these fit the bill perfectly for comfort and style.Go with either the mw75 or these either way you won't be disappointed!","Top notch sound quality, companion app is actually useful, battery life for days and comfortable enough that you can actually wear them for hours on end.","The cuffs themselves are made of vegan leather that are super comfortable, there is no pinch feeling even as you wear these headphones for extended periods of time.The app although not the best is going to be your bestfriend for getting updates and creating setting that work for you.","Sound quality, noise cancellation, and comfort are all amazing.","The headset themselves are soft and comfortable, but not the most comfortable.","They sound better, they mute better, they last longer, and you can wear them for hours without discomfort.","They are SUPER comfortable, which is very nice when you are wearing them for a long time.","Only complaint is the overall shape isn't as comfortable as the XM4s, but I think I need to break them in a bit more.","Good :Active noise cancellation is fantastic!Fast charging is good, bluetooth connectivity is fine!The call quality is amazing.The app shows the SPL levels and it's effects on hearing which is awesome!Bad :360Reality Audio is a gimmick, should've had AptX HD, AptX Adoptive along with LDAC because with LDAC you cannot connect two devices at once.The outer plastic cladding near the foam pads push the frames and makes it a bit uncomfortable (those with specs are better off with XM4).Ugly:The sound quality is good when you don't EQ , but if you use their own apps EQ it's good only upto 70% once you increase the volume beyond it starts to distort and once you turn it all the way up the EQ just flatens and sounds like hot garbage.I don't hear beyond 60-70% volume but even if i want the volume to go to max the SPL doesn't go beyond 99db with any codec I've tried LDAC, AAC, SBC with their upscaler DSEE Extreme no change whatsoever.Also the change in volume beyond 70-75% is really not much and infact the headphones only start to distort!","Seriously Sony who thought of the no folding design?While they're very light and comfy, have great noise cancelling for certain frequencies, contain amazing call quality, have 30-40 hrs of battery and the touch sensors on the right ear cup are SUPER fun and easy to use, I would not buy these if you're also expecting great sound.","They are comfortable to wear.Battery like is mediocre.","!Overall everything about these headphones are spectacular, they are comfortable and look great as well I have absolutely no complaints.","I'm looking for a headphones that is suitable for me and feels comfortable while wearing it for longer time.","I feel comfortable wearing it for longer time.","Battery life is also good, I've been using it for 1 week for casual times and it didn't even tell me to charge it.Overall, This is such a friendly headphone, I am recommending it to anyone who wants a headphones that has (good design, quality, durability, friendly, and comfortable).","The cushions around the ears are soft and it provides a lot comfort.","PROS:Fantastic ANC (utilizes 8 microphones)Paired much easier and quicker than any other BT headphones I’ve triedLouder volume than any other BT headphones I’ve triedOutstanding sound qualityGreat control and features within the AppVery responsive and intuitive touch controls - I raised the volume by correctly guessing to swipe up on the right ear cup.Love the case with a magnetic closure inside that stores charge cable etc.Very happy that they have included the option to use as wired headphonesAmazing battery life (up to 30 hours) with quick charge options (3 minute charge with a USB-PD compatible charger gives 3 hours of use)Can be paired with 2 bluetooth devices at the same timeGood adjustments can be made for a comfortable fitVery lightweight for their sizeCONS:My ears were sweating a bit after prolonged use…could be more comfortable","The earpads and headband are much softer, making for a significantly more comfortable and heat-free experience.","The earpads also do not rotate down when work around the neck, making the headphones quite uncomfortable when resting on your collar bone.","This headset is really great worth buying because the music comes out like magic Isolation is very cool and comfortable Do not be alarmed  The thing that amazed me is the battery, the sound and the insulation well.","This headset is very comfortable on  The head, it can be attached to the right side, touch, I highly recommend buying it Quality is luxurious to the end I really like it","Unfortunately the headband is too uncomfortable for listening for over an hour.","I've used Jabra's Evolve 2 85 and Bose's quiet comfort as my points of reference.Comfort on ear: the headphones are comfortable and fit easily over my ears, they feel like and carry a good balance of pressure.","The ANC easily beats out the Jabra Evolve 2 85 and the Bose quiet comfort ear buds ( this is expected due to the over ear fit)Auto on feature: In an attempt to push the boundaries, there is an auto feature that will try and guess when you want ANC on/off.","I can talk very easily and comfortably via bluetooth with no distortion, no noise pollution and no getting asked to speak louder.","PROS:- new design is lightweight and comfortable- headband is comfortable- touch controls are great and intuitive- auto speak works great- App allows fine tuning and settings- case is solid and slim- ANC is superb- sound is top notch!CONS:- matte finish will grab your fingerprintsI have sampled several of Sony's previous generations of the 1000XM series and though they were great in both sound and ANC performance, I wasn't won over by the fit and feel of the past generations.","These are over ears, so if they don't sit well or the headband doesn't provide a comfortable and secure clamp, then these will swim a bit.","B&W’s ANC was a bit more comfortable for me over Sony’s – I mean that by the level of white noise that the ANC provided.","However, this performance comes at a higher price than the previous generation XM4 (almost 25% higher) and competitive headphones from Bose and Shure, although slightly cheaper than the  Apple Airpods Max.The headphones offer soft leather-like padding for the ear cups and headband, and can be comfortably worn for hours.","This makes it easier to find the ideal setting for optimal comfort.For those that like to travel with their headphones, and appreciate headphones that fold into a compact shape, such as the previous Sony XM4 model and others, you may be disappointed with the MX5.","The headphones are perfect, with phenomenal noise cancellation, great sound quality and very comfortable.","These are the most comfortable headphones you’ll find in this price bracket.","Very comfortable.","Sound quality is great and the headphones are light and comfortable for long listening sessions.","But this is just in another league.These are comfortable to wear, have a decent enough microphone.","Wasted over $450 on the MX4, thought I would just get a replacement set mailed to me after a number times reporting that they just were not working as intended.MX4 vs MX5Cons:-Don't fold up as nicely as the MX4 do-Don't have the same audio alerts (power on/off) that I found useful on the MX4-Not quite as comfortable as the MX4Pros:-Haven't heard the digital sounds using the same devices-Have a slightly nicer appearance compared to MX4","I use these headphones both on Bluetooth to my phone and wired at my desk plugged into an analog music source.I use the ANC in all use cases, and it's really good for mitigating distractions.I have avoided the smartphone app and higher-level configurations as for now I just need headphones to be headphones.Wired Analog; ANC is optional when wired, and a full charge lasts for 20-24 hours of constant play.Wired USB; works well, and of course charges at the same timeBlueTooth; Of course not as rich as an analog source, but still sounds great, and when using as a 2-way headset I'm quite impressed at the sound quality and noise-rejection on both ends.Callers on the other end of a BT call report very solid sound quality on my voice.Runtime per charge is reduced somewhat while on BT, I'd guess something like 10-12 hoursComfort;Spring compression is about right to balance between comfort and sealing.It would be nice if the pad stuffing was a bit more resilient, as on the head the pads compress until my ears are in contact with the speaker grid and that can get uncomfortable after an hour or so.CONS;The ANC does not time out when there's no signal, which has left me several times with a dead battery when I've been interrupted, taken them off and forgotten to power down the headphones.One other \"feature\" that i don't really care for is that speaking aloud while ANC is on cancels the ANC and mutes the source until you manually flip it back on again.","The VA will guide you on the further steps)- The Noise Cancelling (Bummer), The sound (Play the 360 Spatial Audio video on YT)- Volume at 60% should be enough for most people to enjoy the music.- Extremely comfortable to wear for long durations and these charge really fast.- The Bluetooth range is good enough to roam around a duplex without worrying about fades.- The app gives enough customizability freedom.","I love how comfortable these headphones are, the improvements as in terms of ANC and the functionality.","You can adjust and set different sound profiles for whatever you are listening to.The headphones are very comfortable, and I usually hate wearing headphones.","The constant fluctuations in ANC levels are super distracting and uncomfortable.So unfortunate because everything else about the headset is great.","It is the most comfortable headphone I have ever used.","Comfort wise these feel comfortable, not too loose or overly springy tight.","Very comfy, the sound is incredible, and noise cancelation is from another world.","Design is more comfortable than the 4s in my opinion.",".They are super light and wow super comfortableThey so far have not had the white noise issue.","Except they pause when i adjust the head phones and my iPad is … I don’t know where.The transparecy when I talk is great… unless I’m clearing my throat in a noisy environment.So turn off all the cool new features ant you have the most comfortable, longest lasting XM’s ever… for $400.I’ll keeo buying…","I found the previous get not comfortable for my big ears.","Extremely comfortable and excellent noise cancellation.","The headphones are hard to wear due to being uncomfortably warm on the ears.","The noise cancelation is top-notch but difficult to enjoy when my ears are uncomfortably warm even when sitting at a desk.","These headphones are definitely more comfortable, but that is all.","I also tested them against a white noise machine that was 50 feet away, and they failed to block out this steady sound, even with music playing at a comfortable volume.End of Nov 2022, and end of the headphonesI contacted Sony through chat, and they had me reset them.","They feel cheap and the ear pieces don’t feel that comfortable.","The head piece is a bit uncomfortable after a bit of time.","So I wish this product was more comfortable, had now power switch, and had a dock with magnetic charging.","That’s very, very annoying.Those are my primary gripes.The battery life is amazing, the comfort is okay, the new design seems better (my old ones are held together by electrical tape at the hinges).I will be giving these one more week trial, I hope that some software update remedies the issue 🤞","The headphones are simply amazing from sound, comfort and amazing ANC.","The new style ear pads aren’t as comfortable but definitely appear to be more durable.","Noice cancelation, sound quality, weight, comfort, you name it the mark V comes out on top.","It create noise by itself.If you wear it , slightly shake your head, you will hear the leather itself tweak, make uncomfortable noise.","First let’s start of by saying I’m seeing so many positive reviews by people who never owned the xm4 or previous models they sound like promo reviews by SONY if you ask me, so you can understand the frustration by people who have owned previous models, first let’s start with noise cancellation which is awful on the xm5 no manual adjustments to the noise cancellation, and the auto noise cancellation optimization is a zonk on this generation Sony you took something so simple and nice and just messed it up, taking phone calls with these headphones were great and battery life is always awesome with the XM LINEUP,  now let’s start with the clamping force on this one I find myself having to lift the headphones off of my head because the feeling is so tight never had an issue with the XM4, the build quality on this one feels okay and the touch controls are much faster and responsive on this generation, the ability to not fold on this generation is a zonk to me as well but it looks like Sony is going in this direction so this would have some getting used to as they are following the other competitors with their designs as well, sound quality is great not excellent as everyone has their own methods and ideas as to what good sounding headphones are, until the noise cancellation is fixed, clamping force and more comfortable pads I don’t see the reason to try to like these headphones because they are the newest thing out, these manufacturers are putting out junk and not ready products at the cost of my wallet","The most comfortable headphones so far.","Very comfortable.","They are very comfortable has excellent multi-point connection.","I've been using XM3 for about 4 years now.I skipped XM4 as I heard it's not much better than XM3.As for XM5, as I heard it's got phenomenal features, so I wanted to give it a try.For sound quality, it is definitely alot better than XM3-Its directional sound is noticeably better than that of XM3,And music/movies/games just sound so much better.Some of the really cool feature it's got are speak to chat and multiple connection features.Speak to chat allows me to talk to someone freely without taking off the headphones.Multiple connection feature allows me to switch from my PC to my phone instantly when I get a call, or play a video on my phone.As for noise cancelling, XM3 seems to have better ANC.I thought I was able to hear more noises when wearing XM5, but it didn't seem that far off.My biggest disappointment was its comfort.Due to playing video games on a daily basis for long time, I sometimes wear the headphones for 8~12 hours.","XM5 doesn't feel as comfortable as XM3 when wearing for long hours.After about 2-3 hours of wearing XM5, it feels quite uncomfortable and it hurts my ears, which is weird, because XM5 is described to have larger earcups than that of XM3.Due to its comfort, I'm quite unsure if this headphone is worth paying $400 for to upgrade from XM3.","ALSO the top padding was oddly not comfortable, created a pressure point on the top of my head- maybe because the pressure of the tension holding them to my ears was not very strong, so the brunt of the weight was distributed to the top of the head band.","My only downsize would be comfort.","It’s not terrible, but Bose is WAY more comfortable, and my ears hurt a bit after long hours of using it.","i really like the way that they fit on my head, it’s just really light and comfortable to wear for hours at a time unlike other headphones i’ve used that start to hurt after 30 minutes of wearing them so i’d you are thinking about these i would highly recommend them for anyone!!","Great build/ comfort and overall happy with purchase.","Very disappointed by Bose because when I wore the 35 they were very comfortable.","The only thing Bose BARELY is better at is comfort but by barely.",")Comfort 9/10.","Pricey but incredible sound, great noise cancellation and comfortable to wear.Only drawback is they don’t fold down like the previous Sony headphone models.","They are so much more comfortable than my old headphones.","Simple minded old soul here - my wife has Bose Quiet comfort 45 and I purchased these instead.","Relatively comfortable and easy to use touch controls.","I've had them for eight months or so now and wish i had gone with something else.Pros: Good sound, comfortable when wearing.Cons: Auto-shut off, difficult to maneuver for one-ear listening.I've found that maybe I'm weird, but I often like to free an ear to listen to the room rather than the headphones.","The volume could be one setting louder, the noise cancelation 15 % better, but the sound quality and comfort makes these a great fit.","Weighing in at a mere 8.8oz, I'm able to listen to my music in amazing comfort, for hours.","Comfort is top notch and the battery life is amazing.","The noise cancellation was not great it wasn’t that noticeable, and the ear cups didn’t have any cushioning to it so it wasn’t that comfortable.","I can wear them for hours without discomfort, the noise cancellation is not perfect, but it's better than these Sony XM5s, and the design is so much easier to manage and travel with.","The sound quality, features, comfort, and price (well, for the under $500 price point) are unmatched to anything that I’ve ever experienced.Plenty of bass, treble, and midrange for anything that I listen to, with nice functional features like when my wife wants to have a quick conversation (I just hold my hand over the right side of the ear pad and the volume turns low) or if I want to say something without taking the headphones off, it’ll just pause whatever is playing, are nice little features.I’m sure that there are other over the ear headphones out there that are superior, but nothing that I’ve found at this price point.","My wife loves the comfort even with her multiple ear piercings (sorry, but I’ll have to buy her another pair), and on and on…The only thing that I wish it had was Google Assistant in addition to Alexa (but whatever, my Google home still hears me with them on), but I won’t even subtract half a star for that.","The ear covers are also very comfortable, sometimes over ear headphones give me headaches but I haven't had comfort issues with these yet!","Very comfortable, great sound, love them.","Super comfy and truly full noise canceling.","So I will be ordering something to add more cushion to them for my comfort.","The two shortcoming I have found is that the headband isn't as comfortable as the Apple (although I found the Apple's fall off).","Otherwise they have great sound quality, comfort and noise cancelation.","The comfort is much better.","These are stupidly comfortable.","They are super comfortable with or without glasses, sound amazing and battery life is superb.","I had the version 1 of this series (MDR-1000XM or XM1) and the ANC is noticeably better.Comfort: I wear glasses and these have the same problem as the XM1s had and they cause the specs to dig into my head.","This gets uncomfortable after a while.","I tried the Bose QC 35 series and they are much more comfortable with glasses.","It is fine, in every aspect, the sound quality and battery life is just a step ahead from its previously generation.The fit and the comfort though, is just bad for me personally, I struggle to wear this continuously for more than an hour, that’s where it’s really disappointing.","Comfortable but Design is flawed.","Very Comfortable to wear.","The comfort padding is also wonderful.","They're WAYYY more comfy than my EVO's though, like MILES better.","Finally I found over ear headphones that are comfortable to wear.","They are light and extremely comfortable to wear for hours on end.","Better look at alternate lighter options, as all the NC isn't worth the discomfort and risk to your health!","Great noise cancellation, sound and comfort, better than XM4.","Comfort wearing experience for its light weight.","Quality and comfort!","lightweight, comfortable and easy to use.","The transparency mode is good, it is not AirPods max clear but it is absolutely workable plus I don’t use it much so I don’t mind.CONS:They are not very comfortable on my ears.","If this is the 1st over the ear headphone for you, you might not feel comfortable for few days, after few days no issue on comfort.2.","The earcups were quite large, but very shallow so I could feel my ears touching the fabric on the inside, which led to an uncomfortably warm experience.","All good as this top quality headphones are known for.I dont give 5 stars as for my personal taste the volume is a bit low even at the max I prefer a bit more top vol space.The build for these highly rated top tier headphones seems a bit plasticky I expected some durable metal sections on the hinges and buttons, yet it feels well constructed solid and maybe the lack of any metal is to keep the weight down as they are very light and comfortable.Overall highly recommended even against Boss similar offer the Bass on these Sony headphones its noticeably a bit better.","Very comfortable.","Had to switch to this model because XM3 is becoming very hard to findI don't understand the glowing reviewsIt's a step down on the WH-1000XM3 in possibly every way except battery life, which was already long enough to begin withThe padding is much less comfortableBass was apparently balanced and boosted by someone who's deaf to lower frequenciesSize adjustment is needlessly fashionable yet unpracticalMuch more sensible to internal sound from your mouth, or the jack cable touching anythingThe right earphone touchpad sensitivity is ridiculously high, to the point it activates on its own at randomBut worse than all this, while my XM3 models died from the right earphone basically frying out in noise cancelling mode, and what do you know, the XM5 already has right earphone issues barely 1 week after purchase, as opposed to 2 yearsRandom crackling, \"underwater\" audio, issues which can only be fixed by... slapping the earphoneNeedless to say it's not going to last long at this rateAt that price mark this is practically a bad joke and a scam","But are a little bit heavy and get hence get uncomfortable after high usage.","Totally loving it.The design is so much more comfortable.","The headphones sounds good, but they are uncomfortable to wear for long hours.","These are very lightweight & can be worn for longer periods without any ear pain or discomfort.","If you can easily to hear all noises near around then what does it mean.Second Comfortability,  Your head will start paining after 30 min from the top side.Last Sound Quality: This headphone not for music listers.Poor Application, Pricing is bit high and worthless.","Are they comfortable?","They are comfy headphones in terms of clamp pressure after all, but considering the very disappointing sound quality combined with extremely cheap build quality, the XM5's have to be returned.Sony, if you're reading this, please take note!","They are incredibly comfortable, have crystal clear sound, and solid battery life.","The fit is great and they are incredibly comfortable to wear for extended periods.","The padding is good, they are comfortable for short durations, but I have yet to come across a pair of headphones that don't get uncomfortable after a few hours.","As long as all devices are signed into the same iCloud acct you can move the headphones from device to device with no effort.These Sony headphones are cheaper, sound better, and are lighter and more comfortable to wear than Airpods Max.Highly recommended.","The headband, in particular, may not be as comfortable as before due to its thinness.🎧 The microphone is markedly improved from the XM4, although I still wouldn't consider it a high-fidelity microphone.🎧 The transparency mode is still alright, not exceptional.","PROS1) The market's best ANC.12 Quick installation3) Comfortable - The earcups are softly padded and made of a high-quality faux leather material.4) Connectivity- It connects quickly and seamlessly.",").Coming from the X4s which I love, the X5s are lighter and more comfortable.","The headphones are also lighter and more comfortable than I was expecting.","More comfortable, better isolation, cancellation, much better sound quality and better build, superior design.","I'm looking for a super-comfortable set of ANC to mostly use at my desk and block out colleagues.Yesterday, upon opening the MX5's for the *first* time, the zipper was sticky and jammed at mid-point.","I also prefer the larger cups of the HD558 for comfort.","It gives me a very sore head after only 1h of use.People are saying I'm wearing them wrong, need to put the band higher on my head, I've tried this, tried readjusting the cups, but no real difference, and I shouldn't have to wear my headphones a certain way for them to be comfortable.When playing with my Playstation (Oh, they don't work with PS5).","And comfort is better than the XM3, no more discomfort after long flights.","They are very comfortable to wear.","I love how comfortable they are.","However, these are extremely uncomfortable to wear because of the ear cup design.","Aftermarket pads are available, but for this price I’m disappointed that Sony decided to skimp on comfort.","I can't speak to the noise cancelling or the sound because the discomfort of these headphones overshadows all of that.","I have a small head and most headphones hurt me due to to the clamp of the U shape, and the XM4s seemed to have a less pronounced curve so I could wear them comfortably for hours.","I was excited to get these and update my sony 1000xm2 which I've had for 5 years and are still working pretty well.The headphones are comfortable and the sound quality is good, however I'm dissapointed that the noise canceling isn't as strong as the sony 1000xm2.","!Weird beeping that I can't get to stop.These are crazy comfortable, but impossible to use.","EQ ffw.- Very comfortable for ears and very light.Cons:- You can feel the thin head rest digging into your noggin after an hour of use.- Black version will show your fingerprints.- Very uncomfortable if you hang them on your neck.Overall I'd say not bad for home/office.","I see a lot of comments about the comfort not being great but I found these even more comfortable than my Bose QC35 ii.","Extremely comfortable, can wear for allml for conference calls and not notice.","They are comfortable for me to wear for a full work day without any fatigue or ear pain.","These might be the most comfortable headphones I've ever put on, and I've purchased a lot.","They seem to function as well as much cheaper pairs I have, although those aren't nearly as comfortable as these.Great headphones, easy to work with, but the noice cancelling just seems lacking.","Fairly expensive and some reviewers had some pretty negative things to say about them, specifically the comfort and noise canceling.I recommend you go to a trusted audio review site now and read those instead of these Amazon reviews.","Your experience is much more likely to mirror those than the negative reviews.Amazing noise cancellation, great sound quality, and comfortable enough to wear for hours at a time.","Very comfortable and great sound quality.","They’re also very comfortable.","If noise canceling is an important feature for you then these are the headphones to get.My favorite thing about these overall is just how comfortable they are.","I have the Sony XM5 and the Bose QC45.XM5 definitely have better sound quality (the sound is more exciting, bass is amazing).BUT, and this is a big BUT, these are super uncomfortable.The earcups are super shallow, your ears will be touching the inside fabric and your ears start getting hot (really hot) even while sitting.I can’t imagine what will happen if i use them during exercising.The sound quality is not so much better than Bose QC45 that i will tolerate this discomfort.Bose QC45 sound might feel a bit dull compared to the XM5 sound, but the comfort is unmatched.Will be keeping my Bose QC45 and returning these.Really wanted to like these, and they do sound amazing, but the discomfort is a deal breaker.","I was disappointed with the fit of the previous model as they did not fully cover my ears and became uncomfortable after an hour of wearing.","They are fantastically comfortable and fit really well.Unfortunately, the fantastic headphones had two issues that kept me from giving them the 5-stars they might deserve.","The sound is OK but my old Bose were, I think, better.I have a big head (not in the ego sense) and these fit comfortably.","They sit comfortably in my head without squeezing it to death or giving me a headache.","Both of those headphones have excellent comfort with large ear cups and rigid headbands with padding.","They have 4 cm drivers that deliver very punchy audio, with the complaint of bloated bass that can be mostly controlled by EQ.I had high hopes for the XM5 model, but overall it is a downgrade in all categories except for microphone quality.COMFORT - The comfort on the XM5 for me is terrible.","The design, although incredibly comfortable, is rather plastic feeling.","They are quite comfortable and I wore them for several hours at a time and never got any pain from them.","Sound quality, noise Canceling capability, and comfort of the XM5s is just fantastic and its really a premium experience.","These headphones are comfortable enough for me to wear all day without noticable pain or strain.","The sound quality and noise cancelling are very good and, if you don't have big ears, they're very comfortable.","The ANC is also excellent.My only complaint is the comfort and build quality.","There is nothing  I found in their Android app to fix this problem.The headband in narrower than the XM3/4 and therefore more uncomfortable.For the price, seriously Sony, you couldn't add a bigger battery and/or wireless charging?The XM5 anc (noise cancelling) wasn't that much better and it was actually a little worse than the XM3/4 when it came to the dreaded landscaper's two-stroke buzz buzz test....Definitely not worth $400, and not even $350 if you already have an XM4.","New XM5 compared to XM4+Noise Cancellation+Call Quality+Battery Life+Charging Speed+Ambient Sound (Close to real sound)+Slightly More Comfortable+Many more minor improvements in hardware and softwareYou can reach me at my Insta for any information- imtiyaz.azhar","I have a big head, the XM5 fits more comfortably than the XM4 did, and seems to have better noise cancelling.","realy comfort","It is comfortable.","I am loving it.Edit 1:After using it for a day- felt extremely uncomfortable on one particular ear.","Right ear is not that comfortable but it’s way better than others.","Comfortable with great sound quality.","Good comfort in long usageDislikes1.","The cousins are so soft that even if I wear for hours and hours I don’t feel any discomfort.","I heard some people saying that its not comfortable because of its narrow headband and thin ear pads but i didn't find any problem in comfort at all i wear them for 5-6 hours daily while working and they are so much comfortable for me.","Very comfortable feeling.The noise cancelling level is just on and off, there is no manual level adjustment.","These headphones cut out most loud and annoying noises (some noises do still get through but they’re dulled, like your upstairs neighbours doing their daily “hey what heavy object can we drop on the floor” routine) and they’re comfortable enough to wear for long periods of time.","Extremely comfortable, Great build quality, Superb Audio ❤️","Fully expect a YT video on your laptop to suddenly interrupt your phone call out of nowhere.B) comfort isnt as good as it should be at this price.C) design choice of the ear muffs turning outward when worn around the neck is bizzare.","It’s great but if you have an iPhone like me it’s a bit difficult to get used to it.Light weight and very comfy sound quality is great once you customize it.I can wear these all day!","They are soft and comfortable, great sound quality, and the noise cancellation is unmatched.","Very lightweight and comfortable for long sessions.","The older Sony headphones had wider bands and were more comfortable.","No clue what causes this...but I don't think I can recommend these headphones anymore.ORIGINAL REVIEW (**** out of *****):I recently upgraded from the xm4 to the xm5.I had several issues with the previous version (main one being their flawed, slow multipoint BT connection which caused more frustration than the headphones were worth) but some things they implemented on these xm5s are a bit of a head scratcher.PROS:Great sound qualityGreat noise cancellingGreat fit/comfortLong battery lifeSlimmer and less bulky than xm4Better, but not great, multipoint Bluetooth connectionDouble click for spotify is awesomeCONS:Multipoint - still has issues and I have to restart either the headphones or the device it's connected toNot compact/No longer collapsable like xm4 - bummer for travelingHeadphone case is ok but much prefer the xm4 caseThe multipoint was so awful on the xm4 I gave up on them out of sheer frustration.","For my meetings I have to switch to another pair of headphones that do have a mute button but no ANC or long wearing comfort so that is the only bummer.For me, they are incredibly comfortable and the dual connection with my phone is the smoothest and most trouble free I have ever experienced.","Dogs barking, kids screaming, everything you can think of, and ANC is a requirement for getting any work done.So the good:- Ear cups are comfortable, doesn't crush your head after long periods of time.- Sound is good, not absolutely amazing, but good.","\".Sadly, I do no recommend these unless they are on sale and you DIY a comfortable way of wearing them for the top of your head.","For me, they are far more comfortable, with larger earcups that no longer touch my ears and somehow reduced pressure on my head overall.","Coming from the WH-1000XM3s I was expecting these to be a great upgrade in terms of comfort, sound quality, and ESPECIALLY noise canceling but unfortunately that's not the case.","I've attached a video with a recording made using these WH-1000XM5 headphones to give you an idea.Finally, they are very, very comfortable to wear.","Most comfortable headphones I've had by a margin.Bottom line?","As a dude with a bigger head, these are unbelievably comfortable.","They are extremely lite and comfy.","The improper fit causes jaw pain, ear pain, and just general uncomfortableness.","I've used them on an airplane and nearly all air plane noises are cancelled out.The comfort however could still be improved.","Like the XM4s IMO, extended listening starts to feel uncomfortable.","I was stuck on either getting the XM4s or these and ended up with these as they were basically the same price with the Prime Deal.The appearance of the XM5s ultimately made me decide to get these rather than the XM4s, but there is one important drawback I got from these: I can't wear these around my neck comfortably.","The way around this in which I found it the most comfortable would be wearing them above my ear, which is kind of obnoxious in my eyes, but it was the most comfortable position if I didn't want them on my ears.They are super comfortable and I find myself about to fall asleep with them on.","2) they're honestly not comfortable headphones.","Comfort is subjective though, so your mileage may vary.","In re to WM1000XM5First of all I will start out saying these are very comfortable, and the sound quality is excellent with Bluetooth when functioning.Battery life is satisfactory the first month of use, although I hear the battery is not replaceable.Noise reduction - works very well.","The XM5s are also hotter and less comfortable to wear over long periods of time.My other problem with them is that the noise cancelling is a bit too smart with the automation.","I had to turn this feature off, making it useless to me.Due to the poor seal reducing the effectiveness of the ANC to begin with, the smarter-than-I-want-or-need auto ANC, and reduced comfort of fit, I have returned the XM5s.","At 990Kbps, Sony's pull ahead but at the cost of significantly reduced range with my phone (maybe 4-5m and 1 wall, or just having the phone in my pant pocket and bending down can cause drops).As far as usability goes, these headphones are very comfortable even when worn for many hours.","This particular headphone requires no introduction so I'll get right to it; noise cancellation is pretty good but far from perfect but it is significantly improved in comparison to XM4, overall comfort for me is lacking in comparison to XM4, touch control and other features are noticeably better for me particularly the touch control accuracy.","As before, you can manually pause/resume (double tap), skip to next/previous (swipe forward/backward), and turn the volume up/down (swipe up/down) via the touch control at the right ear cup.≡ Physical characteristis/comfortThe overall physical design and style is definitely a step backwards for me particularly when comparing to XM4.","In my mind, it's not just a step backward but a completely failure for $500 headphones.Perhaps the worst of 'em all is the lack of comfort for me in comparison to XM4.","The flat headband from XM4 is much more comfortable for me after prolonged usage.","Although later I've found that the swivel might have something to do with my discomfort as well (can't be certain yet).","All [minor] improvements aside in comparison XM4, if it's NOT adequately comfortable, chances are I ain't gonna wear it, sadly.≡ ValueAll things considered, these are good headphones but are they worth the price tag of $500?","It feels light (250 grams) on the head and the soft earpads make wearing comfortable, even for longer periods of time.","These headphones add a whole dimension to music and what you watch or listen to with these.Pros:- Incredible sound, noise cancelation, and sound isolation.- Incredible battery life which auto stop charging when the battery is fully charged.- Included aux cable to allow for instant sound transfer (great for first person shooters to hear footsteps and shots in the distance)- Sound quality is great and even the pass-through sound makes everything around you as if you weren't wearing anything over your ears.- Extremely soft and comfortable to wear.Cons:- They are very pricey, being $100 more than the precious model.- Since it uses AI to automatically change the sensitivity of the noise isolation, sometimes it let's too much sound through.- The speak to chat is kinda annoying because I've accidentally inabled it a few times and then you can't disable it without going on the app.","After some messing around the EQ settings, these headphones are amazing and clear with clear separation between the lows and highs.Moving on to the transportability and comfortably of the XM5s.","The earcups are extremely comfortable due to the thick and comfy padding made of some type of faux leather.","The noise cancelling however is top tier and completely nullifies most noise which is amazing when doing work.In conclusion, these headphones were a league above earbuds in terms of sound quality, comfortability, ANC and NC.","The new design should be more reliable and should creak less, but it makes the case a bit larger so it may be less packable.Comfort: - The earcups are now a bit deeper with softer foam.","The overall comfort is very good for me, but you do notice a bit more pressure on the top of the head when worn for a long time.","For me, the XM5 is the most comfortable headphone I own.","They gave me an experience I never had or would have had cause I would have never bought them.They are so comfy (I have a XL head) I use these when editing videos during the early morning or night when I don't want to disturb the wife.","The carrying case is so classy!The comfort is superb.","The integrated microphones allowed for crisp call quality as well.I experienced no interruptions or cutting out with my bluetooth connection, it was stable every time.The battery life is outstanding, with only a half an hour charge giving you at least 30 hours of playback time.The headphones are extremely comfortable on my ears, to the point where I forget I’m wearing them.","-noise cancellation is wildly good-comfort is incredible with the vegan leather-great sound quality-took a step back from MK4 with no folding design- carrying case, consequently, is bulky and harder to travel with-for $50 less, you're just about as well with purchasing the MK4's but these are great and I would recommend","I find these comfortable and fit my ears well.","I'm hesitant to return it but after 2 days I have to as it's not comfortable to wear for me.","Sound, noise cancellation, build quality and comfort.","Très franchement je préférai mes Bose QuietComfort pour cet aspect.","I kept the bose 700, most comfortable, better sound and anc, best build construction.First impression, the material used felt cheap.","I love how comfy these are and how FAST they charge!","Pros- Great Unboxing Experience- Look is very Premium- Made from Recycled MaterialsCons- Treble is too Sharp and hurts my ears with \"clapping\" sfx's- Uncomfortable- Slips off of the Head too Easily- ANC is good, but not as good as what I expected- Oil from Head shows on these very EasilyOther- Controls can be a bit annoying, but I think they can be adjusted in the App","The EQ is nice to use- ANC is a bit more comfortable, you don't really feel a lot of pressure in the earsI'll be returning it because I can't use a headphone that hurts to use - a shame but I guess I'll have to wait for the next design revision - hopefully the headband can be larger or have more padding so the weight distribution is better","They are so comfortable even after wearing for a very longtime.","I sent them back and kept the QC 45s, which I highly recommend because of their comfort, durability, and style.","The sound is more bassy though, AirPod Max is slightly more comfortable for big ears, otherwise overall Sony is much better than AirPod Max.","The microphone also sounded equally good or equally bad on voice memo on iPhone.Also have tried Bose QC 35 II, QC 700, ANC is not comparable to Sony's, the sound signature is also not comparable, but QCs are much more soft and comfortable for big ears.","I have bigger ear than normal person and it's not really comfortable for me.","Enhanced even further with noise cancelling on.Comfort: 100% can wear these for hours multiple days in a row with little to no ear pain.Battery: don’t have much to say because the battery lasts for hours and takes almost no time to charge.Case: perfect, well built case you can rely on.CONS:black headphones are hard to keep clean because they’re Matte textured so all oils (including natural skin oils) show up on these like a black marker.Not sure there’s a way to replace the ear cups if they get gross.There’s a little hole between the ear muff and the head band connection point that I am concerned could fill up with gunk over time, not sure these are remotely water proof because of this.Would recommend these headphones, but wait until they are on sale.","++PROS+++ Paired easily to both my phone and PC (individually)+ Using Tidal as a music service to get high quality audio - sounds awesome+ The fit is comfortable, even for long listening sessions+ Good battery life--CONS--- The noise cancellation is good, but could be better- Setting up the multipoint connection (PC/phone simultaneously) was not as intuitive","Super comfortable.","I can say he is particular about sound and comfort of headphones.","Battery was pre-charged to about 65%3) Comfortable - The earcup are soft padded with a faux leather type material that appears to be of good quality.","These headphones are only slightly more comfortable than the XM4, however they tend to let sound in and come off my ears when I moved my head around.","They are the most comfortable headphones I’ve had and the sound quality is top notch.","The design changes, overall comfort (including level of head pressure) and potability have all been significantly improved.","The comfort is amazing, the earcups are really soft and the headphones themselves are really light, with no ear fatigue.","I have owned Bose quiet comfort headphones for the longest time and these Sony ones blow them out of the water.","You won’t feel uncomfortable even after long use…Overall, it’s a versatile product that can meet 95% of anyone’s expectations, whether it be a casual user, bass head, film buff, gamer or an audiophile","I got these mainly because I was looking for a headphones that fit comfortably.","too bad it's uncomfortable to wear because I have a small head.","Good quality sound, ease of use and comfortable to wear for long periods.","They are very comfortable, and my large ears fit into them better than the XM4s.","The size of the opening is bigger, but the depth makes them uncomfortable.","However, this much lighter design thanks to the materials chosen results in supreme comfort whereas the AirPods Max shows its weight after an hour or two on my head.","The AirPods Max feel like their price tag although it doesn’t translate too well in terms of listening comfort for some users.","Comfort can make or break them.The case is much better on the XM5s in comparison to the AirPods Max.","The Sony xm5 sounds great and are comfortable but the the sensor control on right side only works half the time.","Good luck feeling comfortable, unlike the xm3 and xm4, you can't rotate the heads on the headphones, meaning the hard outer plastic will be banging against your collarbone while you walk.","The most \"inconvenient\" thing about them was how I'd never want to take them off because they were so comfortable.","The constant fluctuations in ANC levels are super distracting and uncomfortable.","As a plus, they have oval pads which makes them super comfortable even with multiple piercings and kinda large, I’ve worn them 6 hours straight with no issues.","Headphones are really uncomfortable if put on more than an hour.","Sony has downgraded from xm4.The only 2 good things in this headphones are fast charging and sound quality.Don't buy if you are looking for noise cancellation, comfortablity or upgrade from xm4.","Overall, not worth this price point.Got these to replace my lost Bose QuietComfort 35s, and I can't help but feel these are basically a downgrade in every way.","They are light and can be on for hours without too much discomfort and the battery life is ridiculous.","I have premium wires headphones for \"real\" listening, but still desire hi quality wireless.So, to get the negatives out of the way.My hopes were improved audio and better comfort.I found them to be more comfortable then my Bose for long term wearing and lots of moving around.","they are really heavy, not comfortable at all, The Sony WH-1000XM5, are very comfortable to wear, the battery last a long time, and you can pair them to 2 deceives at the same time which is a really neat feature if you are working in your computer and get a phone call, the sound quality is very impressive, the noise cancellation is good and ambient mode is descent ,  ambient mode is not as good as the airpods max, but considering everything else, I would go with this ones.","The Apple headphones also offer more colors for a more personalized look.-- Comfort: The WH-1000XM5s are significantly lighter than the Apple headphones.","On its face, that should make Sony much more comfortable.","For my smaller head, this is quite comfortable.","It creates a point of pressure on the head that I find slightly uncomfortable.","if you manually turn on passthrough it will accidentally turn on noise canc ... this happens sometimes..- Fit is comfortable compared with others (Bose QC35/45 have also been good to me)- Bluetooth connection is stable 50+ feet from the source.","It's very comfortable, battery life is excellent and you can connect to two devices at the same time so I can receive calls on my phone even when I'm watching a video on my laptop➡️ My main reservations are the case and that it doesn't fold like the QC.","Sounds are so crispy the bass the vocals everything was amazing.Build and comfort(8/10) not sure if it's our ears but the headphones sit on top of our ears.","The pads are most likely made of some type of rubber which still feels pretty comfortable.Sound- I had to update this section because the sound is greatly improved with the EQ, the preset ones are a joke but luckily the EQ is super easy to use.","The downside besides the ANC is that the 40s are heavier and are not as comfortable.Overall these are amazing if you absolutely need the best ANC available.","In my opinion comfort is similar and anc slightly better, I haven’t travelled with these yet, I might add an addendum when I do.","I loved the comfort and connectivity very easy","Sony WH-1000XM5 is an awesome product in this category with great ANC, sound quality and extreme comfort wearing them.Looks are very premium, even to the touch of materials and cushion.","Very lightweight given the size and quite comfortable to wear for longer period of time.The carry bag comes with a USB C cable and a 3.5 audio jack.ANC is very superior in isolating even in a crowded environment, even putting it on without any playback is really good.","Tengo unos Bose Quiet Comfort con los que he estado muy feliz, pero estos Sony son muchísimo mejores en todos sentidos (comodidad, tecnología, bluetooth, batería, reducción de ruido, etc.).","I took them to work and they were absolute trash in cancelling out louder than library level conversations.I tried out the Bose headset and I can say those headsets have far better noise cancellation but are not as comfortable as the XM5’s.I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT MY BEATS FIT PRO DID THE EXACT SAME JOB… BETTER.","Also the xm4 are way comfier","First, it should be said the XM4s are superior to the Bose QC-35s in comfort, sound and ANC.","These headphones also fit tighter, i.e., more  clamping pressure.Simply put, to this user, they are noticeably less comfortable as the XM4s to wear.","With the XM5s, I was constantly fiddling with them to get the elusive comfortable feel.","With the XM4s, I just put them on and they fit like a glove.The XM5s are better than the XM4s in many other ways (8 microphones etc), but for me, comfort is king, something I won't compromise on.","I own the XM4 and other Sony, Bose Quitecomfort, Sennheiser HD 600-800 devices.Comfort is a little better than the XM4.","Wearing glasses I still have discomfort within an hour.","The headband is slightly less comfortable than the XM4.Sound quality is an improvement that was noticeable.","They have good noise cancellation and ambient modes and are comfortable for medium periods of listening.","Apple AirPods Max are heavy and after 45 minutes become uncomfortable on my large head.","The Sony has a better battery life, is lighter and is more comfortable for medium periods of use.","I have a big head and even the Sony headphones get uncomfortable after a straight hour of use and cause my ears to get hot.","The EAH-A800 are better at noise cancellation & ambient modes  and have great sound reproduction & best of all I can wear them for hours with no discomfort.","A comfortable set of headphones with outstanding noise cancellation and great battery life.","Charging is quick too, but you really have to go out of your way to drain the battery to a level where you need to charge it.Comfort is excellent as usual.","They're lighter, more comfortable, and have better noise cancellation.","The WH-1000XM5 fits well enough and is comparably comfortable.","Years ago, I foreswore Sony products because of their poor reliability, ridiculously proprietary nature, and bad service and support.While this product still has stupid proprietary bits (mainly in software), they can be safely ignored, and the device seems to work well with both my Android phone and my Linux computers.The headphones themselves are comfortable, have good battery life, and have much better noise cancellation with enormously more useful features than my old Bose Quiet Comfort 35s.","They feel a little cheap but seem durable enough.Comfort was OK but the lack of padding on the headband and ear cups was disappointing and caused a bit of discomfort.NC was really good as always.","I was hoping that with all the hype the 1000XM5s would be substantially better than the AirPods Max.The biggest complaint is that when touching the ear cup on the Sonys you can easily hear it, the same action on the AirPod Max is minimal.Both headsets have excellent audio, with the Max edging out the XM5s.Controls -XM5 winsComfort - I prefer the Max but it is more an individual choice.Case - XM5Ease of use - MaxNoise Cancelling - Tie","Very uncomfortable!I'm definitely not happy with the xm5 and will try to send them back!","I like how light these headphones are and how it’s comfortable even using them with glasses.","I have had many problems with other headphones because they weren’t comfortable with glasses on but these are so comfortable with glasses","It irritates my jaw after a long time and despite watching youtube videos on adjusting them, I just find I can't get a comfortable setup with them.","Comfortable and easy to use.","The noise cancellation is great and they are comfortable for me.","Supppper comfortable and easy to use.","They feel even comfier than my old set, I'm pretty sure it's because the ear cups are slightly bigger and/or shaped differently, giving my ears a bit more space.There was an update for these that just came out about a month ago (Sept. 2022)  -Improves the Noise Canceling Optimizer function (Auto NC Optimizer)  -Improves the wearing detection function  -Improves general performanceThe new update is pretty great.","The headphones are a comfortable fit at 8.8 oz.","Love the sound quality, noise cancellation is comfortable and it doesn’t feel like i’m in a vacuum, battery life is impeccable, mic is great (very good at voice isolation) and honestly they look so cute.","I know I was concerned about the comfort with the new shape and all but honestly it feels about the same.","Returning as they were just wildly uncomfortable due the fit.","PROS:-highest rated overall headphones for 2022 for comfort, sound quality, mic quality according to some on youtube-comfortable-decent ANC-honestly pretty muddy sound qualityCONS:-no mute function for the microphone-\"customizable buttons\" in the app dont have any actual options for the functions-no fast-charging-really good microphone, stays connected to 2 devices better than bose* returned mine because i need the mute mic function.","Black headphones also show a lot of visible smudges and ear cups were uncomfortable.","Best setting if coming from XM4's is ExcitedThey can be more comfortable and all but NC is way weaker than XM4's in trains and you CAN'T DEACTIVATE the \"Auto NC\".. not on the settings, not Ambient Sound, anywhere... You van set everything to Noise Cancelling but it still changes automatically MESSING UP THE EXPERIENCE.","These headphones are amazingly comfortable when wearing glasses.","XM5s we're marginally more comfortable, but not enough to make a difference to me either.The couple things that were much better was it's ability to auto pause when removing the headphones connect to 2 devices at once (XM3 doesn't have that), the ambient sound mode was so much better, and the headphones overall responsiveness to touch/button controls was much faster.As for noise cancelling, I'm convinced that there is variation in noise cancellation strength between each individual pair of WH-1000XM5 headphones.","I like the feel, comfort, and sound coming from the XM5, but bluetooth can be spotty if you have multiple devices paired to this.","Im assuming this would happen to these as well.I’m sure there was a ton of tech that went into them, but at this price point I expected much more in terms of comfort with the ear cups and headband.Sound quality is amazing, but again, comfort shouldn’t be an after thought at this price point.","Slightly tighter than expected and the padding isn’t great resulting in a bit of discomfort that I’ve gotten used to after a few weeks.","The design changes, overall comfort (including level of head pressure) and potability have all been significantly improved.","Comfort, hours of use, excellent sound, touch features, noise cancellation, no external sound leakage, ease of use.... the list goes on...","So glad I picked these over the black ones.Comfort - most days I have no problem with having them on for 6-8 hrs (my ears don’t hurt at all, sometimes I forget that I have headphones on), but occasionally idk what it is they feel slightly less comfy.","The only other issue is for comfort.","Don’t get me wrong, overall they are super light and comfortable but the light padding on the headband does cause some discomfort after awhile.","Overall they were comfortable and allowed me to forget I was on a plane by cancelling out all of the engine noise.","I already had a pair of Pro Ears Pro Mag Gold for hearing protection but wanted these to help focus on projects and be able to get some well needed sleep.These headphones reduce ambient noises very well but still enables me to hear when someone calls my name, even when sleeping.Pros:- Great if you rest or sleep facing forward- Pairs easily with iPhone and/or computers- Lightweight and comfortable- Easily adjust the head strap- Great if you need to block out room noises and focus on a projectCons:- Bulky and uncomfortable if you’re a side sleeper- Needs an introductory video on how to use the tapping features (pause noise cancellation to speak/listen to others)-There are multiple tapping features available for the headphones but I haven’t found any tutorials on how to make the best of themSummary:The Sony WH-1000XM5 noise cancelling headphones work great if you want them to focus on a project, listen to music or watch a movie however; if you’re a side sleeper and want these to help you block out noises so you can sleep I found these too bulky and they kept coming off.","I forgot to mention they are incredibly comfortable.","Additionally, while I could wear my XM4's all day long, these begin to feel uncomfortable on my head after just 30 minutes.","Finally, the ear cups require a lot of adjustments every time you put them on to find a nice comfortable position.","This makes them pretty much useless and super uncomfortable for audio/video conferencing.Another significant usability problem is the lack of a physical on/off slider — because of this, turning them on or off requires you to take them off and look at the status light as you operate the on/off button, which is slow and disruptive to whatever else you’re doing.Additionally, sometimes speak-to-pause will activate during a conference call despite the feature being permanently disabled, making you look silly as you frantically search for a way to unmute it.Back to my trusty 10-year old Bose!","The headphones are incredibly comfortable and you forget they are there, I have a smaller head and they fit perfectly, they have a lot of room for adjustment as well!","Performs much better than XM4 previous generation✔ Long Term Comfort – I can wear them for long periods of time (several hours) without any discomfort while wearing my glasses.","The audio library for the sound enhancement is also smaller for Sony with limited selections.Comfort: Winner Sony XM5The XM5 can remain on your head for long periods of time (several hours) without any discomfort given its lightweight feel.","When walking around the house, or outdoors, the XM5’s remains on your head without moving.The APM on the other hand are heavier and begin causing some discomfort after 1-2 hours.","The biggest takeaway is being able to keep them on for several hours without discomfort or pain.Build Quality: Winner Air Pods MaxThe APM are built to look and feel luxurious.","So I will sum my experience about this pair in three major areas Comfort, ANC and Call quality and Sound quality.1.","Comfort:These are very lightweight, people complain them for feeling cheap and plasticky thats obvious you dont get lightweight with metal constructions, having said that they provide enough coushioning you will ever need for long hours.","But since they are not as flexible as their predecessors they have a bigger footpring which isnt very comfortable carrying always.2.","If you use spectacles, you won't feel comfortable with these, even if you wear it above your spectacles - you will lose the pure noise cancellation quality as sound enters from the space caused by the spectacles.2.","I decided to upgrade from my mx3's and immediately noticed that these are significantly more uncomfortable to wear.","They’re comfortable - I used to get headaches because of too small ear cushions.","10/10Comfort.","there are 2 issues though, it is extremely uncomfortable on my head which is normal to large I would say and the LDAC bitrate mode selection is not remembered by the device so after each reconnection it is reset to the default mode (which is balanced mode: between speed and quality).","I believe their stated hours of use is probably right and certainly sufficient.I would not say they are so comfortable that I could wear them all day.","They are comfortable enough, but I definitely feel them.","These headphones don’t give me a headache, but I wouldn’t go so far as to say they are the most comfortable headphones I have ever worn, which they ought to be at that price.","They're lightweight, comfortable and I love the material!The sound is great: crisp, smooth and pops!I love the smart features of them pausing and playing depending on whether they're on or off your head.","The build material feels a little cheap for the price compared to the Apple cans but are super light weight and comfortable.","Wide dynamic sound good separation, great battery life, light and comfortable but I would enjoy deeper pads for my big ears but this would change sound signature, Like the EQ with LDACbut aptX HD sounds really good on Shure 50 when EQ'ed can't compare to planers as planers are more laid back Really enjoy the XM5","My screenshot shows battery life near the end which confirms the 30hr claim and from my experience, the comfort, noise canceling features, and sound all lived up to Sony's claims.Easy buy decision.","very comfortable, great noise cancellation.","Awesome noise cancellation, great sound much better than my Bose Quite Comfort","Battery life seems pretty strong too.Now the bad, 2 points, the foam in the cushion part that goes over the ear is on the light and soft side, it can sometimes be pushed back until it starts hitting the casing of the speaker itself, I would have thought it would be a little more robust more cushion around the ear since creating that seal is really important for the noise cancelation feature.The second point is, they also seemed to skimp on the foam in the band that goes over the head, I like it tighter on my head because I don't like the feeling that my ears are holding up the speakers, but the headbands lack of cushion means after hours and hours of wear it started to leave the top of my head really sore and tender since I'm bald my head lacks the extra cushion of hair so this flaw really stands out for me and I have to add an extra piece of foam on top of my head to have them feel comfortable for extended hours of wear.For these two reasons plus the super high price point, I am giving it 3/5 stars.","It's unfortunate Sony seemed to choose aesthetic over comfort, I guess in an effort to appear cool rather than to be super functional.","They take seconds longer to turn on than my old Bose.Overall, I don't feel like they are an extension of me when I put them on the way my old ones did, they are not as comfortable to wear.","The headphones are very comfortable, even for long listening hours.","Nice balanced sound, comfortable to wear.","Feel comfortable.noisy cancellation is perfect.","Best comfort, sound and ANC.","The XM5's are the least comfortable of the three.But all the youtubers that I watched told me that the XM5 were slightly more comfortable than the XM4s and the Airpods Max.","But on me, the XM5s are UNcomfortable within an hour.","I felt comfortable in the previous XM models.I must just be a bad person to disagree with the sponsored youtubers.The most comfortable headphones I've ever used are the Bose QC35 ii.","Much more comfortable, 15%ish better sound quality, and the customizable eq via the app is still amazing.","More comfortable than more basic headphone models for extended wear.","They're comfortable and I have a big head (XL hats only).","The features are as described, the design is comfortable and they look awesome!","I spend at least 2 hours a day listening to music so I wanted headphones that had great quality and were comfortable.","The sound quality is great, it is very comfortable to wear, and the noise cancelling feature works very well.","It had a very nice sound, good range of music type handling, wide soundstage, brilliantly executed noise control circuitry, high level of comfort even when listening for hours, marvelously executed connecting app were appreciated by me.","Charging speed is mind blowing, this pair looks heavy but the comfortness I get with the memory foam is just awesome.","I can see why this model was consistently near the top, the sound quality, touch controls, comfort, noise cancellation, battery life, are amazing!","The cups are really soft and comfortable.","Good design but lacks in comfort and the battery life could of been better the touch control fails time to time have to disconnect from phone to make it to work again and the pause feature when taking them off doesn't work most of the times $566 after tax it's expensive with these issue haven't been resolved even with the new replacement are doing the same thing and it gave off a very bad static  when i turned it off yesterday","Sound quality is fantastic  but my the padding is not thick enough and my ears touch the inside and it gets uncomfortable after a while.Also, the choice of material is questionableas it has a soft plastic covering the cups and within 5 min.","I got my new pair of WH1000XM5 today and I’m absolutely blown away by the sound quality, noise

quality.Battery LifeThe battery on the NC700 lasts me around 13 or 14 hours.","This material fits snugly but with less pressure on your ears while still keeping out the external sounds you don’t want to hear.There were a few other design changes – the XM5s aren’t foldable like the XM4s, and there’s a redesigned case that’s collapsible to save room in your bag when you’re wearing your headphones.With up to 30 hours of battery life, you’ll have enough power to travel halfway to the moon in one of Elon Musk’s rockets.","Go eat, take a walk or do it in your sleep but that battery wasn’t lying about being able to reach 30 hours.","Though I would only limit it to 20-24 hours before checking the battery limit by pressing the power button again and hearing it tell you the power level.","I don’t plan on killing the battery health and you should too for this price point.","In comparison to the AirPods maxes (that I used for a day from my partner) that gave me an incredibly painful headache from the pressure after an hour of use.- Battery life / charging is amazing.","I recently had to travel and ended up wearing them for 6 hours straight!Battery life: The battery was full and by the end of my travel it dropped to 85% so the battery life is outstanding.Noise cancellation: It was really good and didn’t create too much pressure while on.","But as soon as you cover the right ear cup, it switches to ambient sound right away.BATTERY 4/5The device advertises it has 30 hours.","I find battery is used a lot more with DSEE and ANC on but it should last a whole day or more.","He loves the sound quality,  battery life, the sound quality, ability to block or allow surrounding sound,  the sound quality, the durable feel, the sound quality, the range, and did I mention the sound quality.","I found this to be a huge let down and was even more annoyed I needed these myriad of apps to utilize a huge selling feature of the headphones.Besides the compatibly issue the headphones were amazing: great design, amazing audio, and great battery life yet, ultimately for me it’s overly complicated ways and hoops to jump through as an Apple user is what steered me away here.I instead bought the Apple AirPods Max, equally great sound quality, superior design, and elite performance, plus they are insanely and easily comparable with every thing Apple which was a huge selling point for me.","You get better battery sure, but for some reason the cans amplify whatever ambient noise is around you and make them very echo-y/muddy and yes, I made sure it wasn't set to the pass through mode) It's almost like you are in a void and it doesn't negatively affect sound quality by a noticeable margin.For whatever reason you can't use the usb cable to pass through audio so your two options are bluetooth and aux.","The case is nice tho, so they do lay flat - as you can see in people’s pics.I’ve not charged them yet, and I’ve used them loads…so I’m assuming their 30 hours battery life is legit.If you have Amazon Prime, go ahead and order them.","The battery life lasts me about 4-5 days but it honestly depends on how much you use them.","Battery life is unbelievably long, and a few minutes of charging can give you hours of playtime.One complaint: It takes a lot of space.","Sound quality was great, noise cancelling was solid, and initially battery life was fantastic.","I’m sure it’s just a problem specifically with mine as I’ve seen real reviews saying the battery life is solid.","But being blind isn’t a viable solution for me.Summary:Battery wasn’t good on mine, I’m sure that’s just a defect where the large majority will have a great battery life but I can’t vouch for that yetIf you don’t wear glasses, they’re fantastic.","Many other higher-end noise cancelling headphones utilize the tilting headphone as the on/off activation which is easy, efficient, and preserves the battery.","The only thing these headphones really have going for them is their noise cancelling ability and battery life are good.","They fit great and the battery lasts forever.","Not sure about battery life yet, but supposedly these last a lot longer than the XM4's, though I had never used them long enough to drain the battery.","So, I suppose longer battery life is good anyway.","However, if you need better ANC and longer battery life, these might be worth your money.","PROS-Perfectly Balanced Sound Signature (Subjectively better than XM4)-Hands down one of the best Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) Technology-Lightweight and Comfortable (for X amount of hours)-Excellent Battery LifeCONS-Build Quality feels Cheap and Fragile-Earpads can Deform, get Hot (sweaty), and become Uncomfortable-Flimsy Case-PriceyOh wow!","It is perfect for all genres and really enjoyable to listen to.When you take off the headphones, it automatically pauses the music which is a great feature to have to extend the battery life.","The battery life is excellent and can last days without recharging.","They are great, battery life is great, a 10 min charge last me a whole day of usage.","Top notch sound quality, companion app is actually useful, battery life for days and comfortable enough that you can actually wear them for hours on end.","But ironically sometimes a voice will say “battery 80%”.","Even the mdr-v6, or the newer version 7506, are great options with 40mm drivers.The sound on these BT headphones is good, and the battery technology is great.","The smaller mm drivers react to lower powered cellphones quite well and the battery lasts a nice amount of hours.","Battery life can get him through the day.","The battery life is GREAT.","Battery life is similar to other models.","Seriously Sony who thought of the no folding design?While they're very light and comfy, have great noise cancelling for certain frequencies, contain amazing call quality, have 30-40 hrs of battery and the touch sensors on the right ear cup are SUPER fun and easy to use, I would not buy these if you're also expecting great sound.","Because of this reason, battery will also drain a lot.9.","if you use provided wire (generally when battery is low), mic does not work on it.","They are comfortable to wear.Battery like is mediocre.","I had a cheaper set of Sony headphones that had much better battery life.The deal breaker is that they drop the bluetooth connection at least every 20 minutes, sometimes every few minutes.","Having a long battery life, and auto shut off when you take them off are features I wouldn't want to live without now.","They aren't helping you out if the battery is dead.","Battery life is also good, I've been using it for 1 week for casual times and it didn't even tell me to charge it.Overall, This is such a friendly headphone, I am recommending it to anyone who wants a headphones that has (good design, quality, durability, friendly, and comfortable).","PROS:Fantastic ANC (utilizes 8 microphones)Paired much easier and quicker than any other BT headphones I’ve triedLouder volume than any other BT headphones I’ve triedOutstanding sound qualityGreat control and features within the AppVery responsive and intuitive touch controls - I raised the volume by correctly guessing to swipe up on the right ear cup.Love the case with a magnetic closure inside that stores charge cable etc.Very happy that they have included the option to use as wired headphonesAmazing battery life (up to 30 hours) with quick charge options (3 minute charge with a USB-PD compatible charger gives 3 hours of use)Can be paired with 2 bluetooth devices at the same timeGood adjustments can be made for a comfortable fitVery lightweight for their sizeCONS:My ears were sweating a bit after prolonged use…could be more comfortable","This headset is really great worth buying because the music comes out like magic Isolation is very cool and comfortable Do not be alarmed  The thing that amazed me is the battery, the sound and the insulation well.","The battery lasts for a very long time.","The battery is amazing as well.","Perfect battery life and charges right up faster than you can imagine.","Battery life is also excellent.","(i suspect it is forced this way to get that extra long battery life)(i'd rather have shorter battery life than having weak NC)I have used the XM4 for 2 years.","honestly the best sony headphones i’ve used, everything is just right and battery life is amazing.","Very effective, perfect noise cancellation, great sound quality and battery lasts forever.","I use these headphones both on Bluetooth to my phone and wired at my desk plugged into an analog music source.I use the ANC in all use cases, and it's really good for mitigating distractions.I have avoided the smartphone app and higher-level configurations as for now I just need headphones to be headphones.Wired Analog; ANC is optional when wired, and a full charge lasts for 20-24 hours of constant play.Wired USB; works well, and of course charges at the same timeBlueTooth; Of course not as rich as an analog source, but still sounds great, and when using as a 2-way headset I'm quite impressed at the sound quality and noise-rejection on both ends.Callers on the other end of a BT call report very solid sound quality on my voice.Runtime per charge is reduced somewhat while on BT, I'd guess something like 10-12 hoursComfort;Spring compression is about right to balance between comfort and sealing.It would be nice if the pad stuffing was a bit more resilient, as on the head the pads compress until my ears are in contact with the speaker grid and that can get uncomfortable after an hour or so.CONS;The ANC does not time out when there's no signal, which has left me several times with a dead battery when I've been interrupted, taken them off and forgotten to power down the headphones.One other \"feature\" that i don't really care for is that speaking aloud while ANC is on cancels the ANC and mutes the source until you manually flip it back on again.","Noise cancelling is better than the XM$ at eliminating sound I used to get on the XM4 You'll get the same battery life as the XM4 also.","Really like that the batteries hold a charge for a lot longer that l thought they would.","Their battery life too...","That’s very, very annoying.Those are my primary gripes.The battery life is amazing, the comfort is okay, the new design seems better (my old ones are held together by electrical tape at the hinges).I will be giving these one more week trial, I hope that some software update remedies the issue 🤞","Battery life appeared to be very good again.","First let’s start of by saying I’m seeing so many positive reviews by people who never owned the xm4 or previous models they sound like promo reviews by SONY if you ask me, so you can understand the frustration by people who have owned previous models, first let’s start with noise cancellation which is awful on the xm5 no manual adjustments to the noise cancellation, and the auto noise cancellation optimization is a zonk on this generation Sony you took something so simple and nice and just messed it up, taking phone calls with these headphones were great and battery life is always awesome with the XM LINEUP,  now let’s start with the clamping force on this one I find myself having to lift the headphones off of my head because the feeling is so tight never had an issue with the XM4, the build quality on this one feels okay and the touch controls are much faster and responsive on this generation, the ability to not fold on this generation is a zonk to me as well but it looks like Sony is going in this direction so this would have some getting used to as they are following the other competitors with their designs as well, sound quality is great not excellent as everyone has their own methods and ideas as to what good sounding headphones are, until the noise cancellation is fixed, clamping force and more comfortable pads I don’t see the reason to try to like these headphones because they are the newest thing out, these manufacturers are putting out junk and not ready products at the cost of my wallet","Battery life is great.","Great battery life.","Battery life is great and charging time is impressive (40 minutes according to my measures).","Comfort is top notch and the battery life is amazing.","The battery life is amazing !","After first charge on this headset I used it 5 days straight (between 4-8 hours a day) and have just hit 10% battery on day 5.","They are not much of a step up from the XM4s.And... also note that according to Sony: \"We are sorry, but the battery is not replaceable on the WH1000XM5 headphones.\"","They are super comfortable with or without glasses, sound amazing and battery life is superb.","Sound quality is fantastic as well, i enjoy quality sound, own a pair of Beyerdynamic 770dt 80ohm and these Sonies  are just as enjoyable to listen, maybe lag behind the Beyers with quality of sounds, but still sound incredible and I don't have to carry a portable amp to listen to them lolbattery life is another feature that I'm amazed with, listened all day and didn't discharge, i cant say i listened for 30 hours without charge yet, simply because i don't want to run out of battery while I'm listening to an audiobook in an industrial facility, but 10 hours at a time they lasted no problem.","It is fine, in every aspect, the sound quality and battery life is just a step ahead from its previously generation.The fit and the comfort though, is just bad for me personally, I struggle to wear this continuously for more than an hour, that’s where it’s really disappointing.","The battery life seems to live up to its claims.","I charged the headphones to 100% and after 6 hours of straight use, the battery life is at 80%.","I own the 1000XM3 and a bose qc35 and this one's battery life is really impressive compared to them.","This review was written on May 31, 2022PROS:The sound quality and battery life are absolutely amazing.","The battery lasts a long time.","Great battery life and audio quality.","Had to switch to this model because XM3 is becoming very hard to findI don't understand the glowing reviewsIt's a step down on the WH-1000XM3 in possibly every way except battery life, which was already long enough to begin withThe padding is much less comfortableBass was apparently balanced and boosted by someone who's deaf to lower frequenciesSize adjustment is needlessly fashionable yet unpracticalMuch more sensible to internal sound from your mouth, or the jack cable touching anythingThe right earphone touchpad sensitivity is ridiculously high, to the point it activates on its own at randomBut worse than all this, while my XM3 models died from the right earphone basically frying out in noise cancelling mode, and what do you know, the XM5 already has right earphone issues barely 1 week after purchase, as opposed to 2 yearsRandom crackling, \"underwater\" audio, issues which can only be fixed by... slapping the earphoneNeedless to say it's not going to last long at this rateAt that price mark this is practically a bad joke and a scam","For me the standout feature is it's battery life, It's been a week now and battery is still at 16 % without single charge, overall I guess it last between 23-26 hours with ANC.Sound quality is good when you use custom equalizer setting but It's not outstanding, may be I was expecting magic out of it.","Last but not the least, it gives you 30 hours of battery backup (with ANC on) on a single charge & gives 3 hours of backup with just 3 mins of charge.","It provide decent battery life and support fast charging.","No problemo!Battery, I had to charge this headphone only once.","They are incredibly comfortable, have crystal clear sound, and solid battery life.","Battery life has been awesome so far too, definitely plenty for my use.To sum up, there haven't been any major issues that I've encountered while using these.","This si my opinion after one month of use and i am very disappointed.Pro - Good Noice Cancelling- charing battery fastCon - Head band very, very unconfortable after 1h of use- No folding, the new case is much bigger.l- No NFC for connecting with phone- Sound not a big difference from XM2- designSomehow i like the new XM5 but is not better than the XM2 which is much older.First of all the confort, is terrible, the head band is very narrow and and not so soft like the XM2 and i believe XM3 and XM4 are the same.In matter of sound quality you have to listen very carefull to notice a difference, if you think are 3 generation apart you expect something better.You can't fold them, the new case take so much space.On the XM2 i had NFC and i just touched the phone to the headphones and the connection was super fast, super effective.Not anymore with XM5.My personal opinion if you have Sony XM4 or below the XM5 is just a waste of money.","It also has a long range.5) Long battery life and charges fast.6) App features/options - Several options for customizing EQ settings, noise cancellation, transparency, and so on.7) Multiple device connectivity8) I adore the color Sand (white).9) Sound Quality.","It's high quality, with amazing sound quality, is easy to use, is customizable, has many features, and a long battery life.","(was disappointed :( )these headphones shut off randomly when using them, the app has been wildly problematic, settings are constantly reset, the battery doesn’t last as long.","And battery life last so long and I used them daily.","Very good all day use battery life and fast charged.","The battery life has been very good-I get about 30 hours and the touch controls are solid.","No, don’t want to hassle and I do like them, but if you’re looking to buy, I’d wait for a sale or go with a lower model and if you are okay with 6 hour battery life, go with AirPod Pros or for $400, get two pairs of AirPod pros.","Build quality, material, battery life, charge time are all exceptional.","The battery also seems to be very good.","There is nothing  I found in their Android app to fix this problem.The headband in narrower than the XM3/4 and therefore more uncomfortable.For the price, seriously Sony, you couldn't add a bigger battery and/or wireless charging?The XM5 anc (noise cancelling) wasn't that much better and it was actually a little worse than the XM3/4 when it came to the dreaded landscaper's two-stroke buzz buzz test....Definitely not worth $400, and not even $350 if you already have an XM4.","2.5mm jacks (Bose, etc) are useless.- Able to be used when battery dead: these headphones can do that!Finally, the perfect noise cancelling over ear headphones!","New XM5 compared to XM4+Noise Cancellation+Call Quality+Battery Life+Charging Speed+Ambient Sound (Close to real sound)+Slightly More Comfortable+Many more minor improvements in hardware and softwareYou can reach me at my Insta for any information- imtiyaz.azhar","Given that these are $500.00 headphones and that the battery will eventually die.The battery should be user replaceable.","Battery is good.","No clue what causes this...but I don't think I can recommend these headphones anymore.ORIGINAL REVIEW (**** out of *****):I recently upgraded from the xm4 to the xm5.I had several issues with the previous version (main one being their flawed, slow multipoint BT connection which caused more frustration than the headphones were worth) but some things they implemented on these xm5s are a bit of a head scratcher.PROS:Great sound qualityGreat noise cancellingGreat fit/comfortLong battery lifeSlimmer and less bulky than xm4Better, but not great, multipoint Bluetooth connectionDouble click for spotify is awesomeCONS:Multipoint - still has issues and I have to restart either the headphones or the device it's connected toNot compact/No longer collapsable like xm4 - bummer for travelingHeadphone case is ok but much prefer the xm4 caseThe multipoint was so awful on the xm4 I gave up on them out of sheer frustration.","As well as if your Bluetooth connection to your iPhone the iPhone will display his battery level as well.","**Edit after a month of use:Using Multi-device connection is very spotty, 3 out of 10 times the headphones will completely turn off without warning, even with a full battery.","These headphones have been much better than I was expecting and everything is as advertised, especially the battery life, I wear it all day at work everyday with NC on and charge it maybe twice a week at most.","I have to adjust the head phones to sit at a slightly different angle every few minutes.Battery life is excellent.","I haven't used them long enough in one sitting to actually get them low on battery.","In re to WM1000XM5First of all I will start out saying these are very comfortable, and the sound quality is excellent with Bluetooth when functioning.Battery life is satisfactory the first month of use, although I hear the battery is not replaceable.Noise reduction - works very well.","The battery life is pretty good it lasts for days.The price is good for the quality of the headphones it comes in such a nice fancy box that this would be a great birthday or Christmas gift.","These headphones add a whole dimension to music and what you watch or listen to with these.Pros:- Incredible sound, noise cancelation, and sound isolation.- Incredible battery life which auto stop charging when the battery is fully charged.- Included aux cable to allow for instant sound transfer (great for first person shooters to hear footsteps and shots in the distance)- Sound quality is great and even the pass-through sound makes everything around you as if you weren't wearing anything over your ears.- Extremely soft and comfortable to wear.Cons:- They are very pricey, being $100 more than the precious model.- Since it uses AI to automatically change the sensitivity of the noise isolation, sometimes it let's too much sound through.- The speak to chat is kinda annoying because I've accidentally inabled it a few times and then you can't disable it without going on the app.","The sound of it on and off as well as the voice that tells you your battery life and stuff is nice to listen too as well.","The battery life is excellent as well & finally the Bluetooth 5.2 is strong.","It's convenient and safe for commuting.The hear-through is OK. My Airpods Pro are much better at hear-through.The battery life last so very long.","With the phone app it's easy to see what the battery charge is at.Highly recommended.","The integrated microphones allowed for crisp call quality as well.I experienced no interruptions or cutting out with my bluetooth connection, it was stable every time.The battery life is outstanding, with only a half an hour charge giving you at least 30 hours of playback time.The headphones are extremely comfortable on my ears, to the point where I forget I’m wearing them.","Until the battery dies.","When i do a bench press or any activity laying down, it keeps falling down but this is so far the best headphone i ever had from the sound quality and the battery life.","Je porte ce casque pendant que mon conjoint joue de la batterie et ça fonctionne super bien!","I am also old school and would like to be able to switch out dead battery with spare, like I can with my H8.","This has enough battery life for any flight...IF you remember to charge it.","Durability of airpods is really questionable, I and my friends own couple of airpods, they stop working randomly (some times pairing issue, charging issue, misbalanced charge, muffled microphone, sudden sharp drop in battery etc) after warranty period of 1 year, and they are not at all serviceable by Apple.","A feature I honestly thought I wouldn’t need (I use my headphones mainly while I work from home), adds to the focus on the sound quality and keeps me from being disturbed by outside influences.Battery Life: Varies.","I personally think the battery life is more than adequate for an average to higher listener as my first full charge lasted 3 days of almost continuous playback (3 full 8 hour days at work plus after work listening for a few hours)Packaging: Comes with a nice case for storage, but a perplexingly small charging cable (I think it’s 1.5” long?).","It also allows you to know exactly how much charge is left in your headphones so you don’t suddenly hear that “low battery” message when it reaches 10%.","Excellent noise cancelling, sound quality, and battery life.","Enhanced even further with noise cancelling on.Comfort: 100% can wear these for hours multiple days in a row with little to no ear pain.Battery: don’t have much to say because the battery lasts for hours and takes almost no time to charge.Case: perfect, well built case you can rely on.CONS:black headphones are hard to keep clean because they’re Matte textured so all oils (including natural skin oils) show up on these like a black marker.Not sure there’s a way to replace the ear cups if they get gross.There’s a little hole between the ear muff and the head band connection point that I am concerned could fill up with gunk over time, not sure these are remotely water proof because of this.Would recommend these headphones, but wait until they are on sale.","++PROS+++ Paired easily to both my phone and PC (individually)+ Using Tidal as a music service to get high quality audio - sounds awesome+ The fit is comfortable, even for long listening sessions+ Good battery life--CONS--- The noise cancellation is good, but could be better- Setting up the multipoint connection (PC/phone simultaneously) was not as intuitive","Battery was pre-charged to about 65%3) Comfortable - The earcup are soft padded with a faux leather type material that appears to be of good quality.","I have had no issue of any drop at all.5) Battery/Charging - Long enough and charges quickly6) App features/Options - Multiple options to customize EQ setting, noise cancellation, transparency etc.7) Multiple device connectivity8) Love the Sand (white) color9) Sound Quality - Last but not the least sound quality is amazing.","I had been debating between these and the new Apple AirPods Max and so elated I went with these for multiple reasons (battery life, price, NC, bass, and more).","Noise cancellation quality is strong, mic clarity is improved, all of this is quite well known.Several flaws in usability makes the experience a bit deceptive:-You cannot charge while in a call, if battery run out, your out.","Incredible 360 sound, excellent base, superb sound quality and amazing battery life.","I would prefer to keep the ANC at the maximum level when I’m using it - and would be happy to trade more battery life for this option.Also, the XM5 software seems buggy, which caused the ambient button to not work sometimes.","I've had these for about 2 months, with heavy use.They have have excellent sound quality, battery life, and build quality, but basically everything else about them is crap.","so if you run low on battery (which I admit is rare), and you want to keep listening while you give them a bit of charge... you're out of luck.tldr; after 4 months of heavy use, I've concluded these are complete garbage, because the software makes the features actively bad for their usability.","even the long battery life isn't worth this BS.","I need more volume with the smaller drivers (and therefore I use more battery power) with these compared to my XM4s.","The AirPods Max case is literally really only useful to power off the headphones.Battery life is superb on the XM5s at 30 hours or 40 hours with no ANC/Transparency activated.","The AirPods Max has a 20-hour battery life which is inferior to the XM5s on paper but still more than enough for me since all I needed was 8-10 hours of run time to get me through the office for the day.","The XM5s can also operate passively from the 3.5mm analog port using the included cable in the event the battery completely dies.","Look great sound great, battery, only downside is the price but if this is your budget get them.","The one thing good about it is the battery life.It did not come with instructions to set up.","battery life is much more without anc … sound quality is amazing … just only 1 drawback that the leather ear pads are too much sweaty .. order a pair of velour earpads with them which would cost around 1500 rupees !","Noise cancellation, sound quality, battery life all get a 5/5, the ability to recharge the battery in minutes and last for hours is a force to be reckoned with.","The battery life is excellent also I'm getting 26 to 27 hours of life per full charge.","The app drains your battery and tracks you everywhere if you let it.","They are light and can be on for hours without too much discomfort and the battery life is ridiculous.","they are really heavy, not comfortable at all, The Sony WH-1000XM5, are very comfortable to wear, the battery last a long time, and you can pair them to 2 deceives at the same time which is a really neat feature if you are working in your computer and get a phone call, the sound quality is very impressive, the noise cancellation is good and ambient mode is descent ,  ambient mode is not as good as the airpods max, but considering everything else, I would go with this ones.","It is not an issue with the WH-1000XM5s.-- Battery Life: The Sony headphones beat the AirPods Max with 30 hours of battery life compared to 20 hours.","Battery life, sound quality, everything is great!","It's very comfortable, battery life is excellent and you can connect to two devices at the same time so I can receive calls on my phone even when I'm watching a video on my laptop➡️ My main reservations are the case and that it doesn't fold like the QC.","The headphones are very lightweight and the battery lasts between 24-48 hours even with ANC on, depending on how many phone calls I make.","So basically they sound good while their on and in Bluetooth but if you run out of battery and use the headphone jack they will sound horrible, luckily they charge super quickly.Comparison- I honestly prefer the 40s a bit more because they offer better sound despite not coming close to the ANC of these, they are not terrible but the ANC on these are next level.","The battery life on the XM5 is longer (30 hours vs 20), but this is not an issue for me.","Lose battery charge in 24 hours even when switched off.","I also have a pixel 6 pro and it worked as expected with both.Battery - Same as the xm4 which is great.Noise cancellation - Great and slightly better than the XM4s.Overall I think Sony sacrificed portability which is where I put these headphones purpose.","The Sony has a better battery life, is lighter and is more comfortable for medium periods of use.","A comfortable set of headphones with outstanding noise cancellation and great battery life.","Most of the time you don't have to do anything.Battery life is outstanding too.","On a 9-hour overseas flight, I use 10% of my battery using the headphones continuously with the noise cancellation enabled.","Charging is quick too, but you really have to go out of your way to drain the battery to a level where you need to charge it.Comfort is excellent as usual.","Years ago, I foreswore Sony products because of their poor reliability, ridiculously proprietary nature, and bad service and support.While this product still has stupid proprietary bits (mainly in software), they can be safely ignored, and the device seems to work well with both my Android phone and my Linux computers.The headphones themselves are comfortable, have good battery life, and have much better noise cancellation with enormously more useful features than my old Bose Quiet Comfort 35s.","Excellent battery life.","The Sony has a much longer battery life.","Love the sound quality, noise cancellation is comfortable and it doesn’t feel like i’m in a vacuum, battery life is impeccable, mic is great (very good at voice isolation) and honestly they look so cute.","Seamless connectivity switch between 2 devicesWorth the price tagSound quality-5/5NC-5/5Battery-5/5","I love the touch controls, the NC is great, the sound quality is quite good and the battery lasts for a long time.","The noise cancellation, sound quality and battery life is amazing!","Amazing fit, very light, battery lasting close to 40 hours, amazing noise cancelling and transparency mode.","Also after 6-8 hrs of wearing my ears are not sweaty/there’s no condensation in the cups.Battery life - superb, 10-15% drain per 8 hrs like what everyone says.","It does not block 100% of noise, but it is probably the best I’ve ever tested.Battery life is as expected, but if you like it loud with max noise canceling as well as the DSEE Extreme and Equalizer enabled the battery life definitely takes a hit, but is still good.Sound quality is really good.","The only good pros about these headphones is their battery life.","Not to mention the amazing battery life, it lasts so long and it has such a quick charge!","I do miss the voice prompts which are in the XM3's but the battery level is still announced when you click the power button.Sound quality is great in both however going back and forth between the 3's and 5's, the difference is quite subtle to me.","Turns out the headset was turning it self on and off so I'm back to turning them off when not in use for any length of time.The battery on the XM5's outperforms the XM3's however even those have a pretty phenomenal battery performance.Consequently, I met a passenger on one of the flights whom was also using the XM3's and he claimed he tested the XM4's and could not justify upgrading from his XM3's.The experience will certainly differ between individuals so don't take my review as gospel.","Did not provide the advertised battery life - The headphones with a full charge lasted at best 3 hours under constant use for video calls.","Amazing headphones, battery life is 'days'......a Bose guy for 15 years, no more.","Battery life is amazing, but that is to be expected from any premium wireless over your headphones.The touch controls have a bit of a learning curve, but they are for the most part very good (I have one issue with them, but I will get to that later).The noise cancelling is amazing of course, but what is more impressive is the improvements made to transparency mode.","Battery life is excellent and the carrying case is functional and sturdy.","This is my first time owning a ANC headphone..And Im just loving it..❤️Contrary to all other comments here,my primary purpose of considering a ANC headphone was to isolate myself while studying and diving into my Spotify playlists in breaks...Im using android devices (Oneplus 7pro And Galaxy Tab S6)My first options were Oneplus buds pro and Galaxy buds pro...But on a long term reliability standpoint,buds are not all great especially with connectivity and battery backup.So decided to go for the Best in the industry!!","9/10Battery-.","I find my voice very unpleasantly unnatural when listening to voice memos I’ve made.Battery life seems very good.","The battery life is really good too.The only issue I have is that I can’t control the volume at will just like I used to be able with the previous version of these earphones.","Wide dynamic sound good separation, great battery life, light and comfortable but I would enjoy deeper pads for my big ears but this would change sound signature, Like the EQ with LDACbut aptX HD sounds really good on Shure 50 when EQ'ed can't compare to planers as planers are more laid back Really enjoy the XM5","My screenshot shows battery life near the end which confirms the 30hr claim and from my experience, the comfort, noise canceling features, and sound all lived up to Sony's claims.Easy buy decision.","30 hours of battery, light when compared to their competition and the cleanest bass and treble even at the highest volume.","Battery life seems pretty strong too.Now the bad, 2 points, the foam in the cushion part that goes over the ear is on the light and soft side, it can sometimes be pushed back until it starts hitting the casing of the speaker itself, I would have thought it would be a little more robust more cushion around the ear since creating that seal is really important for the noise cancelation feature.The second point is, they also seemed to skimp on the foam in the band that goes over the head, I like it tighter on my head because I don't like the feeling that my ears are holding up the speakers, but the headbands lack of cushion means after hours and hours of wear it started to leave the top of my head really sore and tender since I'm bald my head lacks the extra cushion of hair so this flaw really stands out for me and I have to add an extra piece of foam on top of my head to have them feel comfortable for extended hours of wear.For these two reasons plus the super high price point, I am giving it 3/5 stars.","Using them outside on patio while I work helps drown out the AC and I never reallly wore my other ones anywhere but plane.I was really interested in the 30 hour battery life and quick-charge.","After having low battery on a couple of business flights in the past,  sensitive to losing NC while traveling.","The app shows percent battery left, which is good.","Good for saving battery I guess, but they're a little harder to pair via Bluetooth than my Cowins were.","In addition, the battery seems to last forever.","No issues with battery, sound quality, noise cancellation, Microphones all works perfectly.","I can see why this model was consistently near the top, the sound quality, touch controls, comfort, noise cancellation, battery life, are amazing!","Noise cancelling is amazing, sound quality and battery life are amazing too.","Good design but lacks in comfort and the battery life could of been better the touch control fails time to time have to disconnect from phone to make it to work again and the pause feature when taking them off doesn't work most of the times $566 after tax it's expensive with these issue haven't been resolved even with the new replacement are doing the same thing and it gave off a very bad static  when i turned it off yesterday","I really like the accompanying app that allows you to adjust EQ and indicates what noise cancellation mode it is in along with how much battery life is left.","While I was completely impressed with the superior noise cancelling, the terrible battery life and impossible audio controls (when connected to two devices), made me ship them back.","As long as the battery life rivals the old set (as it's advertised to), these are certainly worth every penny.","They're comfortable on, the call sound is good from both the caller and callee's perspective, and the battery life is impressive, using them for a few calls a day over a week, and I'm still at 60% battery."],"all_scores":[0.7574,-0.2924,0.7677,-0.6652,0,-0.6597,-0.1513,0.5244,0,0,0.6124,0.9831,0.9063,0.6239,0.6124,-0.296,0.8176,0.0516,0.9398,0.5994,0.5267,0.765,-0.1232,0.4404,0.5859,0.9531,0.9134,0.5719,0.8481,0.7906,0,0.9022,0.4576,0,0.7034,0,0.9692,0,0,0.7003,0.2023,-0.0572,-0.7342,0.8779,0.9393,0.9575,0,0.7096,0.3818,0.5719,-0.7964,0.9001,0.9095,-0.0525,0.2732,0.4201,0,0.9399,0.4927,0.9805,0.6249,0.6249,0.8126,0.7964,0.6239,0.2263,-0.0387,0.8492,0.4247,-0.5413,0,0.0258,0.5563,0.624,0,0.6249,-0.9459,-0.5236,0,0.4019,-0.3595,0.7778,0.7943,-0.669,0.3612,0.7717,-0.836,0,0.3384,0.1531,-0.0387,0,0.4927,-0.8828,-0.4559,0.3976,0,0.4404,-0.9519,0.4939,0.2584,0.4404,0.5719,-0.2732,0.9039,0.9571,0.7023,0.7184,0.8442,0.8286,0.5719,0.7089,0,0.7843,0.636,-0.694,0,-0.4005,0.1027,0.3589,0.0516,0.4404,0.7769,0.8847,0.7351,0.7269,0.7481,0.8883,0.9118,0.5719,-0.2617,-0.296,-0.1695,0,0.7251,-0.2144,-0.1779,0.5574,0.4404,0.6239,0.3182,0.5719,0,-0.0433,0.3772,0,0.6588,0.7338,0,0.9594,0,-0.4019,0.7722,0.7574,0.9081,0.6124,0,0.7227,0.688,0.5719,0,0.9746,0,0.9099,0.6239,0.8519,0.817,0.9692,0.4404,0.6239,0.7469,0.6808,0.6369,0.3818,0.9634,0.5719,0.7087,0,0.4927,0.6901,0.9724,0.3612,0,0.9479,0.533,-0.5719,0.4404,0.2382,0,0.4588,0.8122,0.7783,-0.3852,0.4201,0.4576,0.5106,0.8591],"counts":197,"mean_avg_score":0.37,"posneg_list":["positive","negative","positive","negative","neutral","negative","negative","positive","neutral","neutral","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","negative","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","negative","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","neutral","positive","positive","neutral","positive","neutral","positive","neutral","neutral","positive","positive","negative","negative","positive","positive","positive","neutral","positive","positive","positive","negative","positive","positive","negative","positive","positive","neutral","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","neutral","positive","positive","negative","neutral","neutral","positive","positive","neutral","positive","negative","negative","neutral","positive","negative","positive","positive","negative","positive","positive","negative","neutral","positive","positive","neutral","neutral","positive","negative","negative","positive","neutral","positive","negative","positive","positive","positive","positive","negative","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","neutral","positive","positive","negative","neutral","negative","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","negative","negative","negative","neutral","positive","negative","negative","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","neutral","neutral","positive","neutral","positive","positive","neutral","positive","neutral","negative","positive","positive","positive","positive","neutral","positive","positive","positive","neutral","positive","neutral","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","neutral","positive","positive","positive","positive","neutral","positive","positive","negative","positive","positive","neutral","positive","positive","positive","negative","positive","positive","positive","positive"]},{"index":6,"feature_keyword":"price","sentences":["Needless

with a Qudelix 5k cause rip the headphone jack) and they sounded amazing, arguably better than these headphones at a lower price, that's including the receiver.","I had an older pair of Sony

dongle(s) for anything other than your cell phone or laptop… alternatively you can wire the wireless headphones, but from my experience, they lose all sound quality when wired direct (ps5 3.5mm)… so if you think you may watch / play ps5 at night while the Mrs is sleeping, what you’ll get is a wire to the ps5 remote and mono-stereo sound… in other words, when using with a ps5 or Sonys top 80/90 series oLED TVs… they’re about as good as a $5.00 pair of headphones from the dollar store… when paired to a phone / laptop they’re excellent… but imo, they’re way way way WAAAAAAYYYYYY overpriced to

appears that Sony is aiming toward a reference or studio quality; the pure flat sound without any \"juicing.\"","They gave a 5 star performance across all boards, with a standout being in hip hop and hard bop jazz...two things that are pretty different from each other, but are good tests for audio devices.One other thing these have a slight advantage on over the AirPods Max is the price.","I still think there are some things that the APMs do better than these, but these are definitely work the price and in the big leagues when it comes to quality.I don't say this often, but with these...believe the hype.","But still this is something that cannot be acceptable at this price point !Go with it if you want steller noice cancellation and you listen at Max 80% volume.","Given the price of the product, it has big flaws that sony won't address in software updates.1.","Materials are really cheap for the price you pay, plastic can’t even stand a 1.5 meter fall.","!I am amazed and have recommend them to multiple people.They are quite pricey but honestly with this sound quality and this ability to be able to blockout almost all noise is incredible a whole new experience these are worth it if you have the money!","I know it's very pricey, but guess what..","Furthermore, with cheap wired and wireless IEMs providing better sound at lower prices than ever before, wireless noise-cancelling over-ears have become stagnant (in terms of technology, competition, and price) that the value of such a product is questionable.","If you are less price conscious, use the sony ecosystem or looking for a high level of ANC you will be happy with these headphones.","However, this performance comes at a higher price than the previous generation XM4 (almost 25% higher) and competitive headphones from Bose and Shure, although slightly cheaper than the  Apple Airpods Max.The headphones offer soft leather-like padding for the ear cups and headband, and can be comfortably worn for hours.","360 audio is available from premium streaming services such as Tidal, Deezer, Amazon Music Unlimited and others.In summary, these headphones are highly recommended, despite their fairly steep price.","These are the most comfortable headphones you’ll find in this price bracket.","When I first started using the headphones it certainly does live up to its price point and hype/expectations.","Don’t waste your money on this overpriced piece of junk or you will be sorry !","Not worth the price, had to return our set and our refund has still not been issued","It came with hefty price tag of near 400.","I will recommend this headphone to people who can afford its price tag.","while i do think the design of the xm4s are nicer, i think that the xm5s were worth the price difference (which was about $50 at the time im writing this).","And overall it feels like a premium product for its price.","Good quality but overpriced","I already knew I would be getting the best in this price range, but I was actually amazing that they improved on the XM4, because those are (were) top of the line.","These are the most premium you will find at this price, and they are well worth it if you are budgeting for headphones in this range.","Pricey but incredible sound, great noise cancellation and comfortable to wear.Only drawback is they don’t fold down like the previous Sony headphone models.","Sound quality rivals Bose which should be expected for the price.","The sound quality, features, comfort, and price (well, for the under $500 price point) are unmatched to anything that I’ve ever experienced.Plenty of bass, treble, and midrange for anything that I listen to, with nice functional features like when my wife wants to have a quick conversation (I just hold my hand over the right side of the ear pad and the volume turns low) or if I want to say something without taking the headphones off, it’ll just pause whatever is playing, are nice little features.I’m sure that there are other over the ear headphones out there that are superior, but nothing that I’ve found at this price point.","Firstly I would like to say these headphones are absolutely amazing and a great option for its price point but does not have enough substantial upgrades compared to the xm4.","Even with the high price of 399$ I think these cans are totally worth it.","They do the job but definitely overpriced.","This headphone NC and sound is at par with the Bose 700 but consider that the  700s was release in 2019, Sony still some ways to go and definitely not worth the asking price.","I do a lot of zoom calls and the transparency on these are definitely better but again not worth the asking price.","I thought by buying 400 USD headphones I would be blown away.Noise cancelling is nice, but, audio is as good as my 40 and 80 USD headphones from SoundCore and TaoTronics.Noise cancelling might be a little better, but definitely not worth spending 5-10 times what I had with my other headphones.I travel a lot so I thought, I'll pay a premium price to ensure I minimize any outside noise when on a plane or a bus, but it has come with a lot of problems.It pairs with my Win 10 computer, but, audio dissapears every now and then and I have to connect and disconnect.Would definitely return the product if I could, I'm overseas and these are headphones are trouble makers.","Great and worth the price","But it has a very Average sound for the price.","I would not recommend this product for this price, $200 sure but not $400 or more... Just not good enough to demand such a price when there are really good headsets for $100","Nah over hyped over priced not good at all.","Not worth the price","The headset itself is nice build quality, and the mobile application is nice and easy to use but when it comes to pc there is no application besides a community made one that doesn't currently support this version meaning that you cannot adjust EQ settings on pc using this headsets profile, but beyond that i've seen many reviews say this headset has deep, punchy, bass and that too be entirely honest is not true there is no bass and to top it off this headset has extremely poor bluetooth connection support for pc.For this price point if you are looking for a decent headset that has great bass for pc i'd suggest checking out razer nari ultimate.tl;drNo bass for music/games/etcNo application for EQ on pc only has one for mobilePoor bluetooth connection for pc will consistently cutout (un-usable)","What kind of service is that for a popular high priced item from a top manufacturer?!","I've tried many headphones over the years, had an older model which I still love but I decided to try these.I highly recommend these to anyone, don't let the price put you off, you get your money's worth with the quality,  sound and anc.Nice work on eco packaging too Sony.Beautiful case to keep them in too.So happy with this investment!","Probably my only complaint with the SoundCore headphones is the mic quality which causes trouble during calls in noisy environment (which these Sony headphones were the boss at).TLDR: Not worth the price.","Had to switch to this model because XM3 is becoming very hard to findI don't understand the glowing reviewsIt's a step down on the WH-1000XM3 in possibly every way except battery life, which was already long enough to begin withThe padding is much less comfortableBass was apparently balanced and boosted by someone who's deaf to lower frequenciesSize adjustment is needlessly fashionable yet unpracticalMuch more sensible to internal sound from your mouth, or the jack cable touching anythingThe right earphone touchpad sensitivity is ridiculously high, to the point it activates on its own at randomBut worse than all this, while my XM3 models died from the right earphone basically frying out in noise cancelling mode, and what do you know, the XM5 already has right earphone issues barely 1 week after purchase, as opposed to 2 yearsRandom crackling, \"underwater\" audio, issues which can only be fixed by... slapping the earphoneNeedless to say it's not going to last long at this rateAt that price mark this is practically a bad joke and a scam","I got 1000XM5 at a discounted price of ₹21500 using SBI credit card.","If you can easily to hear all noises near around then what does it mean.Second Comfortability,  Your head will start paining after 30 min from the top side.Last Sound Quality: This headphone not for music listers.Poor Application, Pricing is bit high and worthless.","If I had to pick between the two at their price points, I'd go with the XM5 strictly off the new design, but if it's sound-based, they're admittedly not too far off each other.","For example: Audio profiles can be customized or presets can be used.CONS1) The carrying case is large2) the headphones do not fold to fit compactly.3) It can become hot after a few hours of use.OVERALLAlthough it is a bit pricey, it is well worth the price tag.","Worth it if you're seeking the absolute best noise cancelation and can spare the price tag.","I got them at $329.00 so maybe my price impacted my over love for them.The technology on how you can control your music options, do voice option so your music stops is phenomenal.","it made this version more rigid.Overall, this is still a very nice headphone for the price.I would recommend it.","Aftermarket pads are available, but for this price I’m disappointed that Sony decided to skimp on comfort.","I love the quality of these, yes it is a little pricey but it is definitely one of the leading headphones.","The price is too high for a headset.","its half the price of this headset, and hits all the check marks for me.","Awesome sound quality and noise cancelation.Well worth the price.","I've never thought high-priced headphones were worth the price compared to cheaper ones but I'll make an exception for these.","The sound quality on these is really good, but not exactly up to par with some other comparably priced headphones.","I personally haven't had any  qualms with its size but I think it's something to keep in mind.Overall I think these are a fantastic pair of headphones and definitely worth the price if you're coming from the XM3 or earlier.","I just wish they were about half this price.","There is nothing  I found in their Android app to fix this problem.The headband in narrower than the XM3/4 and therefore more uncomfortable.For the price, seriously Sony, you couldn't add a bigger battery and/or wireless charging?The XM5 anc (noise cancelling) wasn't that much better and it was actually a little worse than the XM3/4 when it came to the dreaded landscaper's two-stroke buzz buzz test....Definitely not worth $400, and not even $350 if you already have an XM4.","A bit pricey, but you get what you pay for.","Quality wise, it’s nothing extraordinary, i think it’s pretty average especially for the price.","for a dollar more than the current selling price.","This headphones are small and feels cheap for the price, the feature are nice but there are better options on the market.","And as a bonus they’re stylish and they feel nice to the touch.The only thing that bums me out about these headphones (aside from the price) is that you can only register 2 devices at a time.","They also don’t fold, which might be a drawback if you travel a lot as they take up a bit of space.I tried these and the older models in a local electronic store before I bought them on Amazon and I found that while there was definitely a difference in how much noise they cancelled out, it might not be worth the large price difference to some people.","It feels a bit over priced but the sound quality and the built is better than its competition such as Bose.","Noise cancellation, sound quality are all good, what you'd expect from this series and at this price.","Fully expect a YT video on your laptop to suddenly interrupt your phone call out of nowhere.B) comfort isnt as good as it should be at this price.C) design choice of the ear muffs turning outward when worn around the neck is bizzare.","Up until now I’ve just bought cheap Monoprice headphones and the noise cancelling was laughable.This morning my wife walked out and said “Who was at the door?” I said “what do you mean?”She said some guy rang the doorbell a few times and was yelling at our front door.","What's not to like about them except the price.","Was a bit worried about the price but they are totally worth it!","I was so optimistic that at this price point they'd have a better fit range, but no.","I was stuck on either getting the XM4s or these and ended up with these as they were basically the same price with the Prime Deal.The appearance of the XM5s ultimately made me decide to get these rather than the XM4s, but there is one important drawback I got from these: I can't wear these around my neck comfortably.","The music quality is superb and I haven't noticed any distortion from higher levels of music.The things that would really drift me away, especially at this hefty price point would be:The lack of any water resistance on the headphonesThe ear cups not being able to rotate inwards or fold into themselvesTouch pad gestures should be able to be customizedBut other than the features listed above, they may cater towards you, but the XM4s are generally similar if not better than the XM5s.","When you look at the price of the Airpod Pro it was a no-brainer.","Even if the Airpod Pros were the same price as the Sony's I still would buy the Sony headset.","Also, couldn't find any good ear-pad replacement kits on Amazon for this product, wish Sony gave at least one extra set for this price.","Can cancel the sound a bit more but I feel like I am in a surround sound system .Def recommend- I know it’s pricey but worth itOnly question is why would Sony make such a short charging cable!?","All of these features [continue to] work fairly well in most cases and I particularly appreciate the speak-to-chat feature.≡ Touch controlI'm generally NOT a big fan of the touch control because most of 'em are just finicky to work with, well, not for this (and it shouldn't be based on its price tag).","All [minor] improvements aside in comparison XM4, if it's NOT adequately comfortable, chances are I ain't gonna wear it, sadly.≡ ValueAll things considered, these are good headphones but are they worth the price tag of $500?","For existing XM4 consumers like me, the overall satisfaction vs. price tag ratio isn't one that in my book worthy of the investment at this point.","I know the price is high but the sound quality is amazing!","The battery life is pretty good it lasts for days.The price is good for the quality of the headphones it comes in such a nice fancy box that this would be a great birthday or Christmas gift.","Very durable and definitely worth the price!","These headphones add a whole dimension to music and what you watch or listen to with these.Pros:- Incredible sound, noise cancelation, and sound isolation.- Incredible battery life which auto stop charging when the battery is fully charged.- Included aux cable to allow for instant sound transfer (great for first person shooters to hear footsteps and shots in the distance)- Sound quality is great and even the pass-through sound makes everything around you as if you weren't wearing anything over your ears.- Extremely soft and comfortable to wear.Cons:- They are very pricey, being $100 more than the precious model.- Since it uses AI to automatically change the sensitivity of the noise isolation, sometimes it let's too much sound through.- The speak to chat is kinda annoying because I've accidentally inabled it a few times and then you can't disable it without going on the app.","Sony is competing with several other brands and has priced this headphone at mid-pack.","I think it is matches or surpasses the others in the same price range.","This is great, since you won't find the same in other brands.Overall:  - For me, the XM5 is worth the asking price as the competitors are similiarly priced.","The carry case to me is a little cheap feeling I think at this price it should have a little sturdier of a case.The materials of the product feel amazing.","For the steep price of $500, I definitely want my headphones to tune every other noise out.The sound quality was crystal clear, it made listening to music so pleasant.","They are a little pricey, but if you can afford they are great!!","I purchased the Anker q35 at the same time, and felt the sound and anc to be comparable on both which was upsetting considering the price of the Sony.The Sony touch is EXTREMLY glitchy.","Unacceptable for the price.Original review below.I use this for flying, and in public where I really do not want to interact with anyone.","At this price point I expect everything to be excellent, and it is.","For this price I would have expected better engineering and quality.",":)AirPod 2 and AirPod 3 are just same (No ANC either) for all practical reasons, AirPod 2 Pro and AirPod Max comes with ANC, AirPod 2 Pro is good but comes with INR 27,000 price tag.","AirPod Max is also x2.4 times pricy than these (Whooping INR 60k).","And the special pre-order price they have mentioned is also a scam.","The price is the same even after release.","The headphone manufacturing quality is not good when compared to the price.","Sony is a lot better than Beats these days and better pricing.","I'm giving this 3 stars mainly for the fact that the price increased and not all of the features are completely flawless.","I don't think the price for an upgrade from the XM4's or other headphones in similar price range is worthy.","But does it deserve the price tag and delivers on that.","I had been debating between these and the new Apple AirPods Max and so elated I went with these for multiple reasons (battery life, price, NC, bass, and more).","The XM4s still sound pretty good, and I would not recommend upgrading to these right now at this price point.","If you're coming from the previous generation model, the differences are immediately noticable.The price has increased but considering there's a chip shortage and they improved literally all the right aspects of this new pair.","Just get a cheaper version or wait for this to reduce in price.","Very much not worth the price","Am not blown away by the sound quality but after tuning the equaliser settings, I am happy with it.ANC is top notch, it’s definitely best in that category, maybe beating even AirPods Max.Quality of materials used is right for its price, can’t expect more but the cushioning is just great!","these are definitely worth their price and if you are looking to upgrade then these are fine- you won’t be disappointed (al though there’s like nothing super crazy in terms of change).","Pros1) ANC (but not mind-blowing)2) Bluetooth Connectivity3) Touch Control4) Mobile Application with loaded featuresCons1) Sound Quality isn't that great for this price range2) Bass is minimal","Wouldn't recommend at this price point","I haven't bothered, but I think the fact that it's even needed for what should be a relatively simple device speaks volumes.If these were not priced at the top of the mass market headphones, their lack of polish would be forgivable.","But for the price, they're embarrassingly bad.update: my opinion of these has continued to decline with use, to the point where I almost want my old corded headphones back.","When I wear these overpriced earmuffs with the noise canceling activated, as soon as I say a word out loud, the noise cancelling goes poltergeist and shuts everything off.Waste of hard-earned money.","I also own the WH-1000XM4, and the cheap plastic that binds the headphones together broke on those.So there's my review of these (and every other) Sony products... overpriced and lacking quality.","Overpriced and falling apart.","The AirPods Max feel like their price tag although it doesn’t translate too well in terms of listening comfort for some users.","Not worth the price previous generation sounds better in noise cancellation and volume control.","With all the above Cons decently it is pricey.","Look great sound great, battery, only downside is the price but if this is your budget get them.","I wanted a pair of headphones for my game room but couldn’t find anything pink, noise cancelling and high quality worth the price.","That's not a quality product for this price.","Quality is not that different then some open backs that are half this price.","Overall, not worth this price point.Got these to replace my lost Bose QuietComfort 35s, and I can't help but feel these are basically a downgrade in every way.","I have had better experiences with headset 1/3 of the price.1.","Overall, I prefer the AirPods Max, but the Sony's have several strengths that will make it more appealing to some users than the Apple headphones (despite the WH-1000XM5's atrocious tongue-twister of a name).-- Price: Out of the gate, the Sony's beat the AirPods Max on price.","They are $150 cheaper at MSRP and $80 cheaper at current prices.","The question is, does the AirPods Max provide enough value to justify its higher price?-- Materials and Design: This is a subjective comparison, but the AirPods Max has the better build and design in my estimation.","The better price, sound quality, and storage are likely noticeable enough to many that they would purchase them over the AirPods.","At this price I would expect a decent case, even the case included in the previous generations was perfectly fine.","All in all, these headphones are impressive in some areas and have a few issues and flaws, but whether or not they're worth the asking price is entirely up to you.","Both headphones are not close in price but they do share the same features and are from well regarded brands.ANC- These headphones definitely have really impressive ANC, the sound is not the best but if you absolutely need the best ANC then these will probably be it based on so many online reviews.","So in reality the price difference might only be $50.","The price reflects the quality, but if it’s within reach of your budget or a bit of a stretch more, you would not regret the purchase afterwards.","I bought these headphones used and for a greatly discounted price and i have to say they worked and looked brand new when i got them and they definitely were worth the price i paid.","Seamless connectivity switch between 2 devicesWorth the price tagSound quality-5/5NC-5/5Battery-5/5","It was disappointing for the price.","Im assuming this would happen to these as well.I’m sure there was a ton of tech that went into them, but at this price point I expected much more in terms of comfort with the ear cups and headband.Sound quality is amazing, but again, comfort shouldn’t be an after thought at this price point.","The price has increased but considering there's a chip shortage and they improved literally all the right aspects of this new pair.","The price is steep but the performance and sound quality is outstanding.","I tend to be very careful when I make any purchase that has such a steep price to pay but I have to admit that I got \"exactly\" what I paid for and without one iota of regret.","The sound quality is better though, but for the price you’d expect the noise cancellation to be better than years old models.","Compared to the XM4's these are a massive downgrade and are not worth the price.","The sound quality, the noise cancellation, the design and quality is just not up to par with the price that’s being asked for.","These headphones are simply NOT worth the gargantuan price.","This means between the cable and the case; you’re looking at almost $100 of added expenses with the APM.Moreover, the price at the time of this review is $499 for the XM5’s and $779.00 for the APM.","The price difference between both is also substantial given they are close in most categories.","My beats solo cost half the price and I really enjoyed them better.","For the price they aren’t worth the quality","I did not expect it to be perfect but for the price I still don’t want to step out of a room to take a phone call because of any background noise.5.","I also tend to bump them less.Overall, these have good qualities but I don’t believe they’re worth the price.","I think you would be able to find over the ear, noise cancelling headphones with less glitches and issues for a cheaper price.","Previously I have used the 1000xm3's, those were my first proper bluetooth headphones and were the best in that upper price range in my opinion.","Great sound quality and software.. Could be priced better, not value for money product.","These headphones don’t give me a headache, but I wouldn’t go so far as to say they are the most comfortable headphones I have ever worn, which they ought to be at that price.","The build material feels a little cheap for the price compared to the Apple cans but are super light weight and comfortable.","I was a little reluctant to buy these for the price, but they are totally worth it.","For the price point, I expect the headphones to be damn near perfect, because of my job I have to wear these guys anywhere from 6-15 hours a day so every aspect of a headset is important to me.I am not an audiophile but they sound great to me, rich and stuff.","Battery life seems pretty strong too.Now the bad, 2 points, the foam in the cushion part that goes over the ear is on the light and soft side, it can sometimes be pushed back until it starts hitting the casing of the speaker itself, I would have thought it would be a little more robust more cushion around the ear since creating that seal is really important for the noise cancelation feature.The second point is, they also seemed to skimp on the foam in the band that goes over the head, I like it tighter on my head because I don't like the feeling that my ears are holding up the speakers, but the headbands lack of cushion means after hours and hours of wear it started to leave the top of my head really sore and tender since I'm bald my head lacks the extra cushion of hair so this flaw really stands out for me and I have to add an extra piece of foam on top of my head to have them feel comfortable for extended hours of wear.For these two reasons plus the super high price point, I am giving it 3/5 stars.","Obviously this comes with a bigger price tag..","For the price point of $350, these headphones are an all around disappointment.","While pricey, they really are the best noise cancelling headphones I've ever owned, and I've had several sets of Bose.","Definitely not worth the price tag.","I was initially hesitant to purchase these because of the price, but they are worth every penny.","I would have kept it even thought it is pricer than other competitors if it was easy to use, but it is not."],"all_scores":[0.4404,0,-0.1279,0.7579,0.7684,-0.6597,-0.4767,0.4404,0.6369,0.1621,0.2878,0.6249,0.5423,0,0.204,-0.1615,-0.2188,0.8176,0.1622,0,-0.3412,0.4404,0,0,-0.4939,0.8825,0.9531,0,-0.5574,0.4497,0.8047,0.6705,-0.3149,0,-0.1027,0.9276,0,0.2263,0.5719,0.3182,0.4201,0.5563,0.34,-0.5255,-0.1695,0,0.3612,0.5859,0.3612,0.2382,0.9343,0.4588,0.9366,0,0.8611,0.6237,0.2944,0.5499,0.3718,0.2025,0.9425,0.7184,0,-0.7829,-0.4226,-0.1695,-0.121,0.5983,0.9323,-0.7404,-0.9459,0.4215,-0.34,0,0.224,0.7269,0.5165,0.6801,-0.2263,0.7906,0,0,0.7184,0.1154,0.2724,0.8957,0.4019,-0.8828,-0.1531,0.743,0,0.6956,0.743,0.1862,0.5927,0.4404,-0.5432,-0.2869,-0.2755,0.3573,0.177,0.6597,-0.298,0,0,0.2486,0.8417,0.6406,0.422,0.8074,0.7574,0.9571,0.6317,0.7023,0,0,0.7184,0.6151,0.8702,0.8039,-0.4767,-0.5401,0.5719,0.4404,0.2382,0,-0.25,0,-0.3412,0.7003,0.796,0.4404,0,0.7481,0.6111,0.4939,0,-0.2334,0.9663,0.3999,-0.5096,-0.2755,0.5075,-0.5483,-0.2023,-0.4215,-0.1531,0.7269,0.3036,0,0.5574,0.0387,0,-0.0516,-0.3843,0.4404,0.5499,0,0.6757,0.4404,0.7184,0.039,0.5839,0,0.485,0.624,0,-0.4939,0.9239,0.4939,0.7579,-0.3079,0.7003,-0.1695,0,-0.1695,0,0.2023,0.7755,0.2263,0.4215,0.5106,-0.2023,0.6369,0.7153,0.4748,0.8957,0.3476,0.9253,0.9479,0,-0.5106,0.5667,0.2579,0.2144,0.2382],"counts":196,"mean_avg_score":0.26,"posneg_list":["positive","neutral","negative","positive","positive","negative","negative","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","neutral","positive","negative","negative","positive","positive","neutral","negative","positive","neutral","neutral","negative","positive","positive","neutral","negative","positive","positive","positive","negative","neutral","negative","positive","neutral","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","negative","negative","neutral","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","neutral","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","neutral","negative","negative","negative","negative","positive","positive","negative","negative","positive","negative","neutral","positive","positive","positive","positive","negative","positive","neutral","neutral","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","negative","negative","positive","neutral","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","negative","negative","negative","positive","positive","positive","negative","neutral","neutral","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","neutral","neutral","positive","positive","positive","positive","negative","negative","positive","positive","positive","neutral","negative","neutral","negative","positive","positive","positive","neutral","positive","positive","positive","neutral","negative","positive","positive","negative","negative","positive","negative","negative","negative","negative","positive","positive","neutral","positive","neutral","neutral","negative","negative","positive","positive","neutral","positive","positive","positive","neutral","positive","neutral","positive","positive","neutral","negative","positive","positive","positive","negative","positive","negative","neutral","negative","neutral","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","negative","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","neutral","negative","positive","positive","positive","positive"]},{"index":8,"feature_keyword":"connectivity","sentences":["I

I’ve not listened to in a long time.","Walking in the other room my 700s would start breaking and stuttering teh signal before disconnecting.","Also when using connecting to 2 sources the switching is seemless.","The electronics do correct it, but turn them off and use the included headphone cord in a passive, wired connection, and you'll hear what I'm talking about.I'm in no way dinging them for anything they do, or don't do.","But always disconnecting and not working with Teams.","And it's about damn time that the headphones in this series support multipoint connection.","I have a pair of $40 Bluetooth headsets, not noise-cancelling, that NEVER lose connection with my devices; but these Sony Headphones lose connection all the time.","There is nothing in my apartment that should affect the connection, which wouldn't also affect the cheaper headphones, but the Sony headphones always drop the connection.","When it is connected, they work well, and the noise-cancelling is great, but the frequent drops make this purchase a bust.","The sound quality is great, but every so often it disconnects from my computer.","The “I turned on” and “I turned off” sounds are distinct but I could not write down how to tell them apart (even if I knew) from the similar pleasant chimes for “ANC on/off” or “Bluetooth paired / disconnected”.","I’m hearing details I don’t normally hear.My only complaint is with connectivity.","Works fine pairing with iOS devices, but it’s NOT a supported device for connecting to a PS5 via Bluetooth.","You want quality listening connected to highend equipment, it ain't BT technology.","He can walk from one end of our house to the other with the Bluetooth connection.","Connects to all your devices very easily6.","Good :Active noise cancellation is fantastic!Fast charging is good, bluetooth connectivity is fine!The call quality is amazing.The app shows the SPL levels and it's effects on hearing which is awesome!Bad :360Reality Audio is a gimmick, should've had AptX HD, AptX Adoptive along with LDAC because with LDAC you cannot connect two devices at once.The outer plastic cladding near the foam pads push the frames and makes it a bit uncomfortable (those with specs are better off with XM4).Ugly:The sound quality is good when you don't EQ , but if you use their own apps EQ it's good only upto 70% once you increase the volume beyond it starts to distort and once you turn it all the way up the EQ just flatens and sounds like hot garbage.I don't hear beyond 60-70% volume but even if i want the volume to go to max the SPL doesn't go beyond 99db with any codec I've tried LDAC, AAC, SBC with their upscaler DSEE Extreme no change whatsoever.Also the change in volume beyond 70-75% is really not much and infact the headphones only start to distort!","Very bad connectivity, unusable in many scenarios.","I had a cheaper set of Sony headphones that had much better battery life.The deal breaker is that they drop the bluetooth connection at least every 20 minutes, sometimes every few minutes.","I just install the app and they connected without having to do the traditional Bluetooth pairing (Used Samsung S20FE).","It easily connects to bluetooth on any device.It has touch control on the right side of the headset that allows me to pause, play, skip tracks, control the volume, activate voice assistant and answer phone calls.","Hopefully software updates improve this feature, but for now it's turned offCase: the Case is nice and protects the headphones well, the ability to squeeze or compress the case is limited and should not be considered when choosing to buy.Voice: Voice is decently clear and acceptable for most uses, while not comparable to a boom-style microphone, I don’t anticipate these being used for business purposesApp + Connecting: The app experience is average and what you would expect if you have ever had to download a headphone/speaker app before, the essentials are there and it allows for easy setting adjustment and updates.","Connecting the device to computers, phones and TV was easy and intuitiveOverall: The headphones are a good buy in the high-end ANC range, be sure that the level of ANC you need matches these headphones.","There is a 1/8” jack as well for connecting a hardwire.","Summary:Very good noise cancellingTop notch sound performanceExcellent Bluetooth connectivityMore expensive than similar competitors, and even Sony’s previous generation XM4Does not fold into a compact shapeThe recently released Sony WH-1000XM5 (from now on I’ll just refer to them as the “XM5”) is the latest set of noise cancelling wireless headphones from Sony, building on the success of the previous model, the XM4.","A bit expensive but well worth it.30 hours of continuous use plus excellent noise cancellation.Also, does not disconnect or lose BT connection in crowded are with other BT be it in cars or headphones.","I enjoy even wearing them at home without connecting them to anything to have a quiet time with myself.","The connection is weak and doesn't support multiple room roaming.","If I have to give full mark, I will give it for noise cancellation(10/10) ,sound quality is also good as well as Bluetooth connectivity.","The bluetooth connection is solid, the microphone is a pleasure.","Connected to my phone easily and quickly.","Noise cancellation is grade A when it's powered on.But the constant connectivity issues forced me to return it.","Just not as functional as when they’re connected to one device.","I turned off the touch control in the app and it turned back on next time I connected the headphones.","No, it wasn't the phone, and it wasn't the connection, they just randomly power off.","Mine also seem to decide they are just going to turn themselves off while actively connected to a device and playing music.","These try hard and the noise cancellation is great, but the 360 sound is weak and just off..I got them for work, but the mics and connection did not do well with the limited use I did.Not bumming!The warning says no sweating lol, no problem these will fall of your head well before a sweat is broken, annoying.","I says it's connected but it wasn't.","They are very comfortable has excellent multi-point connection.","I've been using XM3 for about 4 years now.I skipped XM4 as I heard it's not much better than XM3.As for XM5, as I heard it's got phenomenal features, so I wanted to give it a try.For sound quality, it is definitely alot better than XM3-Its directional sound is noticeably better than that of XM3,And music/movies/games just sound so much better.Some of the really cool feature it's got are speak to chat and multiple connection features.Speak to chat allows me to talk to someone freely without taking off the headphones.Multiple connection feature allows me to switch from my PC to my phone instantly when I get a call, or play a video on my phone.As for noise cancelling, XM3 seems to have better ANC.I thought I was able to hear more noises when wearing XM5, but it didn't seem that far off.My biggest disappointment was its comfort.Due to playing video games on a daily basis for long time, I sometimes wear the headphones for 8~12 hours.","Even without playing anything, it muffles the noise enough that I feel somewhat disconnected from the crazy traffic.","With its industry leading noise cancelation system, you can enjoy high quality sound from  Bluetooth or enjoy the headphone's full frequency range of an astounding, 4 hz to 40k hz,  with its 3.5mm, wired connection option, while still being able to experience the sounds of the world around you.Either way, you get a wide sound pallet, from deep punchy base to crisp highs anda well defined midrange.The available software found on the Sony website, allows you to fully customize the way sound is reproduced by the large 30mm, soft edged drivers, giving you full control over how you enjoy, music, movies, dialog and much more.In my opinion, these headphones compare favorably against other more expensive premium name brand, noise canceling headphones available today.","Required only connection Bluetooth that means non secure for work.","I’ve tried resetting and disconnecting but it’s still low.","But their ANC is not as strong as the sony's.Bluetooth connectivity: They work flawlessly with a single connection and the range is also great.","The problem is in multi device connectivity.","When connected to two devices, it's not so great at switching to the correct host.","Like say it's connected to my laptop and phone and I play music on my phone.","It will stay connected to the laptop even though nothing is playing on it.","For instance when I would be on call on Facebook messenger or WhatsApp the microphone in use would be my phone's but I can hear the person clearly because the speaker is always connected.","The sound quality is no doubt amazing and I heardparts of songs I had never heard before but I could not take any calls while working and had to go through the whole process of either disconnecting Bluetooth or holding the phone Infront of my face.","Bluetooth connection with multiple devices is seamless.","The headset itself is nice build quality, and the mobile application is nice and easy to use but when it comes to pc there is no application besides a community made one that doesn't currently support this version meaning that you cannot adjust EQ settings on pc using this headsets profile, but beyond that i've seen many reviews say this headset has deep, punchy, bass and that too be entirely honest is not true there is no bass and to top it off this headset has extremely poor bluetooth connection support for pc.For this price point if you are looking for a decent headset that has great bass for pc i'd suggest checking out razer nari ultimate.tl;drNo bass for music/games/etcNo application for EQ on pc only has one for mobilePoor bluetooth connection for pc will consistently cutout (un-usable)","Overall, I found the default EQ curve on these Sonys to have too much colour, and the EQ controls in the Bluetooth-connected Sony app did not allow me to reduce this colouring enough.","My only request is to pls enable mic (if it is possible technically) while headphone is connected to PC via aux cable.","The headphones keep disconnecting from the device.","I tried with my iPhone, iPad, Macbook Air, Windows PC, and Android phone, and in all cases, the Bluetooth connections were dropped for no apparent reason.","Micro corrects, mais problèmes de connectivité, donc micro non fiable.Connectivité multipoint problématique.","C'est là, mais pas aussi simple et automatique que mes Jabra.Sur ce sujet, les Jabra sont les champions!À plusieurs reprises, le casque cesse de fonctionner sans que je sache pourquoi, je dois l'éteindre, le rallumer et retourner le connecter dans l'application ou dans les paramètres audio de mon PC pour que ça revienne.","Before NC700, my daily driver was QC 35 II.The primary reason is the multi-point connections and call quality — before XM4, Sony didn't have a multi-point connection.","But connecting these things via Bluetooth is totally hit and miss - at best.","Each time I have to go through a connection process usually several times - usually involving removing the headphones from the sound output device and starting to connect them again from scratch - before the headphones will connect again.","Bluetooth connectivity is great, and these connect to my phone very quickly.","However right out of the box the connectivity problems abound and noise cancel only works streaming music and then not that good.Today my neighbor came in with his new “B” brand headset and it connected and he was on a MS Teams call on his same laptop in seconds.","The app constantly thinks when you are on 1 GIG wifi that you’re not connected.","If you turn off your wifi then it can reach the internet on 5G.This is an ok headset for music ONLY but save yourself the headaches of hours of pairing and repairing and connecting and enable and disable if you plan to use this with Windows 10 or 11 MS Teams or use it for phone calls - noise cancel will not work - let alone use the mics on the headset for conference call on a laptop.I did find a resolution.","Never mind the wasted hours on connectivity for the Sony wh1000-xm5.","You can see the AG hands free option is paired but it WILL NOT CONNECT to enable the mics other pic also shows only connected for music.","This si my opinion after one month of use and i am very disappointed.Pro - Good Noice Cancelling- charing battery fastCon - Head band very, very unconfortable after 1h of use- No folding, the new case is much bigger.l- No NFC for connecting with phone- Sound not a big difference from XM2- designSomehow i like the new XM5 but is not better than the XM2 which is much older.First of all the confort, is terrible, the head band is very narrow and and not so soft like the XM2 and i believe XM3 and XM4 are the same.In matter of sound quality you have to listen very carefull to notice a difference, if you think are 3 generation apart you expect something better.You can't fold them, the new case take so much space.On the XM2 i had NFC and i just touched the phone to the headphones and the connection was super fast, super effective.Not anymore with XM5.My personal opinion if you have Sony XM4 or below the XM5 is just a waste of money.","Then BT connects.","PROS1) The market's best ANC.12 Quick installation3) Comfortable - The earcups are softly padded and made of a high-quality faux leather material.4) Connectivity- It connects quickly and seamlessly.","It also has a long range.5) Long battery life and charges fast.6) App features/options - Several options for customizing EQ settings, noise cancellation, transparency, and so on.7) Multiple device connectivity8) I adore the color Sand (white).9) Sound Quality.","In top of all the good stuff, i am totally in love with the option of connecting 2 devices at the same time.Watching TV not worried at missing phone calls, and when I answer the sound is so clear and other side can hear me so clear","However, the headphone kept disconnecting every so often.","Blue tooth connects easy.","I've done this for years with various headphones connected to either my Apple TV or more recently a Sony TV.","Unfortunately when it disconnects the audio plays at full volume through the regular speakers which makes it a bad choice for listening at night while my wife is trying to sleep.","I honestly can't find much that hasn't been said already that these headphones live up to for the most part.However the key issue (and cause for 2 stars off) is that for all these headphones can do (and despite some tricky connection gymnastics with the app / Bluetooth, though I chalk most of that up to the technology not Sony) you cannot mute/unmute your microphone in any way with this headset (at least not out of the box or through any settings or searching I've done) even though the headset has mappable functions, and even unmapped button patterns that i can only use for one service and cannot assign to any useful functions.","You can't connect these to the app on your phone if the headphones are connected to something else with an audio cable.","Interestingly, they would be connected without being acknowledged by the app.-I saw others mention the issue about sweating.","The connection was stable around the house, but I would still have to head back to my computer to mute/unmute.","The headphones sound muffled and flat when using the wired connection.","However, Apple has led the way in disposable headphones...and other manufactures follow.The app equalizer is very good and a must to optimize the sound.ANC is very good.Connecting is an exercise in frustration.","The app does not always recognize that the headphones are connected, quitting the app fixes the issue.","Also the dual connection of bluetooth is not good as it does get connected to two devices simultaneously but still the sound only gets played from the last device connected but it shows that its connected to both the devices.","ANC is very nice, And about bluetooth connection, While switching on it connect with my laptop suddenly but taking time to connect with phone at the same time ...","So many times I have both my phone and computer connected - I'm on my laptop, I stop the music then try playing something on youtube on my phone, but there's no audio.","No problem, sometimes I can just double tap on the xm5 to open spotify and I'm connected to the phone so I can go back to youtube and the audio will play...but nope it'll play the spotify music but not youtube.","But the audio on my computer still connected and works.","No clue what causes this...but I don't think I can recommend these headphones anymore.ORIGINAL REVIEW (**** out of *****):I recently upgraded from the xm4 to the xm5.I had several issues with the previous version (main one being their flawed, slow multipoint BT connection which caused more frustration than the headphones were worth) but some things they implemented on these xm5s are a bit of a head scratcher.PROS:Great sound qualityGreat noise cancellingGreat fit/comfortLong battery lifeSlimmer and less bulky than xm4Better, but not great, multipoint Bluetooth connectionDouble click for spotify is awesomeCONS:Multipoint - still has issues and I have to restart either the headphones or the device it's connected toNot compact/No longer collapsable like xm4 - bummer for travelingHeadphone case is ok but much prefer the xm4 caseThe multipoint was so awful on the xm4 I gave up on them out of sheer frustration.","They would never switch to the other device properly and there were ridiculous delays - whether it's connecting or playing another device.","It also notifies you every time a device is connected or disconnected from the headphones - which is great but I wish I could turn this off since it constantly pings when I go out to the laundry room with my loads of clothes and disconnect or connect to my laptop.I'm happy with these headphones but really wish there was a more elegant way to carry them around.","As well as if your Bluetooth connection to your iPhone the iPhone will display his battery level as well.","For my meetings I have to switch to another pair of headphones that do have a mute button but no ANC or long wearing comfort so that is the only bummer.For me, they are incredibly comfortable and the dual connection with my phone is the smoothest and most trouble free I have ever experienced.","Edit after 5 months of use:Disconnects are more frequent, and at times it would suddenly lower the audio quality.","The only way to fix it is to stop everything you're doing, turn it off, turn it on, and hope it reconnects.","**Edit after a month of use:Using Multi-device connection is very spotty, 3 out of 10 times the headphones will completely turn off without warning, even with a full battery.","Only thing I hate is that if I have my phone and laptop connected, and I paused media on my laptop.","Great sound quality, solid materials, great connectivity and range, but I have to return them.","However, and this is a big one, sometimes there are problems with connections.","Every time I try to connect them, my headphones make this weird noise and get disconnected automatically.","But there are a couple of major flaws that resulted in me returning them: 1) the Bluetooth connectivity with both my Pixel and my Macbook Pro was very unstable and unpredictable.","1) Random turn off (not power or user interaction related, and not related to \"keep on while wearing\" setting, _OR_ (2) no sound is output for headphones even though PC shows connected, the player is playing.","It takes about 10-20 seconds to get back to working for the stack to re-establish the connection..- In the case of random pauses of your YouTube player.","The only problem I have is that depending where in our house we are located the headphones disconnects a lot!","It does have Bluetooth connectivity as well, and it can be connected to two devices at the same time!","if it is connected to both a phone and a computer, whenever the call comes in, it will automatically stop the music playing on the computer and switch to the phone so you won't ever miss an important call again!The most outstanding features of these headphones, in my opinion, are the smart features, which you can turn on/off as you need.","With Sony's headphone app it was very easy to connect them both my phone and my laptop as well due to its \"multiple device connectivity\".","The integrated microphones allowed for crisp call quality as well.I experienced no interruptions or cutting out with my bluetooth connection, it was stable every time.The battery life is outstanding, with only a half an hour charge giving you at least 30 hours of playback time.The headphones are extremely comfortable on my ears, to the point where I forget I’m wearing them.","These headphones had everything I wanted - ANC, two connections at once, great sound, but I couldn't keep them on my head for more than 30 minutes without the headband hurting the top of my head.","The auto-noise cancellation optimizer is nice, overall I’ve had less issues with connectivity (i.e.","At first, I had a hard time connecting it to my macbook but it connected so no problem.","Inital connection to my pixel 6 phone was easy.","The headphones also support wired connection which is good so you get better quality but xm5 is not supporting mic with wired connection.","Enhanced even further with noise cancelling on.Comfort: 100% can wear these for hours multiple days in a row with little to no ear pain.Battery: don’t have much to say because the battery lasts for hours and takes almost no time to charge.Case: perfect, well built case you can rely on.CONS:black headphones are hard to keep clean because they’re Matte textured so all oils (including natural skin oils) show up on these like a black marker.Not sure there’s a way to replace the ear cups if they get gross.There’s a little hole between the ear muff and the head band connection point that I am concerned could fill up with gunk over time, not sure these are remotely water proof because of this.Would recommend these headphones, but wait until they are on sale.","Not to say that there are any controls missing but I'd prefer to customize it.Lastly, something about connecting to 2 devices simultaneously is that it works but not seamlessly.","For example, when I'm connected to my phone and playing music on it, the headphone doesn't change to iPad automatically when I start to play a video on the iPad.","This is still easier than disconnecting and reconnecting devices but could be improved(maybe?","++PROS+++ Paired easily to both my phone and PC (individually)+ Using Tidal as a music service to get high quality audio - sounds awesome+ The fit is comfortable, even for long listening sessions+ Good battery life--CONS--- The noise cancellation is good, but could be better- Setting up the multipoint connection (PC/phone simultaneously) was not as intuitive","Will have to see how it performs during sweaty, hot environment.4) Connectivity- It connect seamless, and quickly.","I can literally walk all around in my home or in my backyard away from my phone and it stay connected.","I have had no issue of any drop at all.5) Battery/Charging - Long enough and charges quickly6) App features/Options - Multiple options to customize EQ setting, noise cancellation, transparency etc.7) Multiple device connectivity8) Love the Sand (white) color9) Sound Quality - Last but not the least sound quality is amazing.","They wouldn’t stay connected to any device and randomly disconnected.","The Bluetooth connection does need to be set EACH time I use it with any apple products.","The new pair sometimes disconnects randomly but not much and a quick button click gets it back on.","The foam padding could definitely be a bit denser as it does deform easily.My biggest problem was that they had issues connecting to my Bluetooth receiver I bought for my TV.","big issue in call.-Sound notification (on, off, pairing, connected), are so random, you don't know what's happening, and what's the status.","Should have a speech \"you are connected\", \"you are disconnecte\" ... many competitor have it.-Pairing is not super smooth or reliable...","Box in open stateNo

point it didnt charge, turn on and although sound came from the left ear with aux it obviously could not work in the right ear.","The XM5s charge via the more standard and easily accessible USB-C

cannot fault if I try.","Am not blown away by the sound quality but after tuning the equaliser settings, I am happy with it.ANC is top notch, it’s definitely best in that category, maybe beating even AirPods Max.Quality of materials used is right for its price, can’t expect more but the cushioning is just great!","They say the new carbon-fiber material and tinkering with the tuning makes it sound better.","Perhaps, but why didn't they just use the new material AND keep the 40mm drivers, as a larger driver will normally yield stronger sound, though some may say it's not necessary.","Also the material of the pads is soft but collapses more, making you feel the tightness on the side of your head.","However, this much lighter design thanks to the materials chosen results in supreme comfort whereas the AirPods Max shows its weight after an hour or two on my head.","I think it's once again because of the material.","The sound quality was great but the material feels cheap.","I'm

just like a normal set of headphones.One of the problems I have always found with over ear headphones was with the ear cups sticking to my skin over a long period of wearing them, or just feel greasy from skin oil after awhile.So after a number of cleanings, the leather, or whatever material it is, possibly vinyl, would potentially start to peel.","Those carbon fiber dual drivers, 8 noise canceling mics and custom audio co-processor Sony keeps referring to in the marketing materials, are genuinely significant.","But although the headphones are made of recycled materials it still has a slightly more premium build quality than some but is nowhere the build quality of some others like the Bang & Olufsen Beoplay H95’s.","But they are unbelievably light weight so that is a good reason

sure why such expensive headphones have such cheap materials.","And unfortunately I cannot find a way to re-connect the pieces, there's not enough material to glue together without blocking the earcup from rotating.","They're lightweight, comfortable and I love the material!The sound is great: crisp, smooth and pops!I love the smart features of them pausing and playing depending on whether they're on or off your head.","The build material feels a little cheap for the price compared to the Apple cans but are super light weight and comfortable.","Neither are they as portable due to fix sides, but the plastic material feels cheap, and the overall design makes them really difficult to wear when doing anything but sitting still, as they often shift or even fall off entirely, which was not a problem whatsoever with the XM4s!Overall, the sound is still great, but this is not what a \"new\" generation of an electronic device should be.","Sound quality is fantastic  but my the padding is not

ask me, so you can understand the frustration by people who have owned previous models, first let’s start with noise cancellation which is awful on the xm5 no manual adjustments to the noise cancellation, and the auto noise cancellation optimization is a zonk on this generation Sony you took something so simple and nice and just messed it up, taking phone calls with these headphones were great and battery life is always awesome with the XM LINEUP,  now let’s start with the clamping force on this one I find myself having to lift the headphones off of my head because the feeling is so tight never had an issue with the XM4, the build quality on this one feels okay and the touch controls are much faster and responsive on this generation, the ability to not fold on this generation is

great not excellent as everyone has their own methods and ideas as to what good sounding headphones are, until the noise cancellation is fixed, clamping force and more comfortable pads I don’t see the

believe XM3 and XM4 are the same.In matter of sound quality you have to listen very carefull to notice a difference, if you think are 3 generation apart you expect something better.You can't fold them, the new case take so much space.On the XM2 i had NFC and i just touched the phone to the headphones and the connection was super fast, super effective.Not anymore with XM5.My personal opinion if
